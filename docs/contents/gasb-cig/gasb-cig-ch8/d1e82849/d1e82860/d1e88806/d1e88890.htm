However, if measures using the alternative measurement method for an agent employer&#39;s individual-employer plan also are included in the aggregated information reported by the agent multiple-employer plan, the agent employer should obtain new measures of that information at least as frequently as is required to satisfy the financial reporting requirements of the agent multiple-employer OPEB plan in which it participates. In addition, a new measurement should be made sooner &quot;if, since the previous valuation, significant changes have occurred that affect the results of the calculation, including significant changes in benefit provisions, the size or composition of the population covered by the plan, or other factors that impact long-term assumptions.&quot;</div></body></html>
