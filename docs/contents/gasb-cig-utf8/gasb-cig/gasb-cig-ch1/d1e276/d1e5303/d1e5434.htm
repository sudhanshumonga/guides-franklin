Because mutual bond funds invest in many debt issues with different maturity dates, the maturity date of the fund is not fixed. That is, the net asset value per share for a bond fund changes.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Bond funds generally own many debt investments with differing maturities, so a bond fund reports duration or average maturity—the average of all the debt investment maturities in a fund's portfolio, weighted by the par value of each investment. For example, a mutual bond fund with a weighted average maturity of 8.5 months could be reported using the segmented time distribution as an investment with a maturity of less than one year.</div></body></html>
