First, the custodian is required to have physical custody of the securities (or, as discussed in Question <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_the_custodian_s_use_of_correspondents_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_the_custodian_s_use_of_correspondents_rec1">1.24.1</span>, another party should be holding the physical securities in the name of the custodian for the benefit of the custodian's clients). Second, the custodian's internal records should identify the government as the owner of the bearer securities. For bearer securities pledged to the government as collateral for deposits or for repurchase agreements, the only difference for meeting the criterion is that the custodian's internal records should identify the government as the pledgee of the securities. </div></body></html>
