Specifically, the pool distributes income to participants on a quarterly basis based on their relative participation during the quarter that is calculated based on (1) realized investment gains and losses calculated on an amortized cost basis, (2) interest income based on stated rates (both paid and accrued), (3) amortization of discounts and premiums on a straight-line basis, and (4) investment and administrative expenses. This method differs from the fair value method used to value investments in these financial statements because the amortized cost method is not designed to distribute to participants all unrealized gains and losses in the fair values of the pool’s investments. The total difference between the fair values of the investments in the pool and the values distributed to the pool participants using the amortized cost method described above is reported in the net position section of the statement of fiduciary net position as undistributed and unrealized gains.</div></body></html>
