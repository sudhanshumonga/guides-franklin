Members of the board may be removed only for cause. The authority's purpose is to provide safe, decent, and affordable housing to the residents of the city. Operations of the authority are subsidized by the federal government and other grantors. The housing authority determines its own budget, subject to federal approval, sets rental rates, and may issue debt in its own name. The city is not responsible for deficits or liabilities of the authority.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The housing authority is not a component unit of the city; however, the city should disclose the authority as a related organization. The governing board of the authority is appointed by a city official, but the city is not able to impose its will on the authority and there is no financial burden or benefit relationship between the city and the authority.</div></body></html>
