The infrastructure should be reported at its acquisition value, which is determined as of the date of donation. Should a separate asset be reported for the right-of-way easement associated with the donated infrastructure? If so, how should the value of that asset be measured? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. A separate asset for the right-of-way easement should be reported at acquisition value in accordance with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs72_acquisition_value">paragraph 79</span> of Statement 72. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_undivided_interests_rec1">Question 4.57</span> about classifying right-of-way easements associated with infrastructure.) As described in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_jointly_governed_organizations_rec1">Question 4.54</span>, the acquisition value of an asset is the price that would be paid to acquire an asset with equivalent service potential in an orderly market transaction. In the case of right-of-way easements for roads, however, generally the only willing buyer is the government. Therefore, the outlay the government would have made to acquire the easement in an exchange transaction can be used to determine its acquisition value. In most cases, a right-of-way easement for a road is, in substance, equivalent to ownership of the land because the grantor of the easement retains virtually no right of use. Accordingly, the acquisition value of the associated land could be used to approximate the outlay that would have been incurred by the government had it acquired the donated right-of-way easement through an exchange transaction and, therefore, could be used as a basis to determine the acquisition value of the right-of-way easement. There also may be other reasonable methodologies for determining the acquisition value of a donated right-of-way easement. However, forgoing the determination of the acquisition value of a donated right-of-way easement and instead arbitrarily assigning the easement a nominal value would be inappropriate.</div></body></html>
