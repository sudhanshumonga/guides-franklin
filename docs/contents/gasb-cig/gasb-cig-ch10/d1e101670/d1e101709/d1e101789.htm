In return, the counterparty agrees to transfer to the government’s agent a U.S. Treasury or other high-quality security. The second part of the repurchase agreement is a forward contract. In this contract, at the end of the agreed upon period, the government’s agent will deliver that security to the counterparty, and the counterparty will deliver to the government’s agent an amount that represents the return of the government’s principal, plus interest. Because the repurchase agreement is neither negotiable nor transferable, this forward contract is nonparticipating (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs31_par._8">paragraph 8</span> of Statement 31). That is, the contract does not have the ability to capture market changes. For example, if market interest rates move in the favor of the government, the forward contract provides no means for the government to realize a gain based on those changing market interest rates. </div></body></html>
