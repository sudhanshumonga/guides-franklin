If the government chooses to receive a series of payments over time, does this structured payout meet the net settlement characteristic in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.13">paragraph 13a</span> of Statement 53?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—A contract that provides for a structured payout meets the net settlement characteristic provided that the fair value of the discounted cash flows to be received are approximately equal to the amount that would be received if the contract is immediately settled in cash. For example, in lieu of receiving an immediate payment at settlement of $4,329,477, a government agrees to receive a series of annual payments of $1 million over the next 5 years. Assuming a 5 percent discount rate, the present value of the structured payout equals the contract’s net settlement amount. This contract, therefore, meets the net settlement characteristic in paragraph 13a.</div></body></html>
