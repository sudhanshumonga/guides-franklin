For business-type activities, the same components of net position are required in the enterprise fund financial statements, and generally the amounts from the fund statements will also be presented in the government-wide statements. The base amounts for the restricted and unrestricted components of net position for governmental activities are displayed in the governmental fund financial statements. The unrestricted component of net position is initially composed of nonspendable (except for permanent fund principal), committed, assigned, and unassigned fund balance amounts.</div><div class="ps_centered_heading_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_centered_heading_1">* * *</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate how <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fund balances</b> in governmental funds are converted to the required components of <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">net position</b> in the government-wide statements. Exhibit 3A is the calculation of the components of net position for the municipal government in nonauthoritative <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_illustration_a__illustrative_financial_statements_for_a_municipal_government__rec1">Appendix B7-1, Illustration A</span>.

As mentioned above, paragraph 32 of Statement 34, as amended, requires restricted components of net position to be displayed in detail by major categories of restrictions. The restricted categories for each government are presented as column headings on the worksheets. Columns for the unrestricted component of net position and for the net investment in capital assets component of net position should also be included.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Next, the fund balances of the governmental funds should be spread across the various restricted categories and nonspendable, committed, assigned, and unassigned amounts should be entered in the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">unrestricted</b> column, as appropriate. Note that permanent fund principal amounts are classified as nonspendable fund balance in governmental funds but should be reported as a restricted component of net position in the government-wide statement of net position.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The final phase is to allocate the items in the reconciliation of fund balances to governmental activities&#39; net position to the appropriate categories and make any other adjustments that may be necessary. No category of the restricted components of net position can be negative. Therefore, if additional liabilities in the reconciliation that relate to restricted assets exceed those assets, no balance should be reported; the negative amount should be reported as a reduction of the unrestricted component of net position.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">In each of the illustrations, the government&#39;s spending priority policy is to consider restricted resources to have been used first, followed by committed, assigned, and unassigned amounts when expenditures have been incurred for which resources in more than one classification could be used.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_111" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span>(<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_112" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> (<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_113" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> (<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div></body></html>
