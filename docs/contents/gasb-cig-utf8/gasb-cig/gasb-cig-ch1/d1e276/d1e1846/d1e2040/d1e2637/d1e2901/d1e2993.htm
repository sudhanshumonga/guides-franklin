Governments can obtain detailed information about these accounts from the district banks of the Federal Reserve. (See also <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_special_collateral_arrangements_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_special_collateral_arrangements_rec1">Question 1.36.1</span> on Federal Reserve pledge accounts.) </div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> Book entry safekeeping accounts for state treasurers:</b> One financial officer of a state, generally the state treasurer, may have up to two accounts in only one Federal Reserve Bank or Branch for the safekeeping of securities—an investment account for the state's own securities and a customer account for the securities of the local governments in the state. Except as discussed below, the states are not allowed to have accounts with which to make funds (cash) transactions. Therefore, for the state to purchase or sell securities at the same time it delivers or receives cash, the state has to work through the accounts of a financial institution that has both a funds account and a securities account with the Federal Reserve. Securities purchased and sold have to be transferred between the state's safekeeping account and the financial institution's securities account. Because of this, safekeeping accounts are practical only for securities that are to be held on a long-term basis.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> TREASURY DIRECT:</b> A government also may have an account with the U.S. Treasury in the Bureau of Public Debt’s book entry system known as TREASURY DIRECT. Any individual or organization may maintain an account in the TREASURY DIRECT system. Like the state treasurers’ safekeeping accounts, TREASURY DIRECT accounts may not be used for cash transactions and are practical mainly for holding securities on a long-term basis.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> State-owned limited-purpose trust companies:</b> A state may form a limited-purpose trust company if permissible under the laws of the state. Such a trust company ordinarily would be eligible to obtain access to an account at a Federal Reserve Bank which would permit funds transfers and book entry security transactions. The state’s account at the trust company would enable the state to take or make delivery of book entry securities at the same time it delivers or receives funds without going through the accounts of a financial institution.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> To have a funds account, a state is required to establish a limited-purpose trust company through an act of its legislature. The trust company is required to obtain a guaranty of its obligations from the state, and the state is required to waive its sovereign immunity for any claims the Federal Reserve has for any liability the trust company incurs with respect to the funds account.</div></body></html>
