The fiscal dependency criteria in paragraph 16 relate to special-purpose governments with governing boards that are not appointed by the primary government. These criteria focus on the basic actions necessary for an organization to function as an autonomous government. If a special-purpose government is required to rely on another government to carry out any one of the responsibilities included in these criteria, it is not fiscally independent and is not able to function with autonomy. This would be true regardless of how the governing body of the organization is determined. In those cases, if there also is a financial benefit or burden relationship present, the special-purpose government would be included as a part of the reporting entity of the government that holds those powers.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The ability to impose will plays a different role in the determination of whether a primary government is financially accountable for an organization. Imposition of will was added as a means of determining whether the appointment authority granted to the primary government would result in financial accountability. Therefore, imposition of will creates financial accountability only when coupled with the authority to appoint a voting majority of the potential component unit&#39;s governing board.
