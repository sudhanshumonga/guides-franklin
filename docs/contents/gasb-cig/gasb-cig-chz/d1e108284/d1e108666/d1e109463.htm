Therefore, if a capital asset is donated to a government and is held for use in general government operations, no asset or revenue is recorded in the governmental fund. If a capital asset is donated to a government and is being held for sale, it would be recorded at acquisition value, which is determined at the date of donation, as an asset of the fund that will receive the sales proceeds and as revenue.
