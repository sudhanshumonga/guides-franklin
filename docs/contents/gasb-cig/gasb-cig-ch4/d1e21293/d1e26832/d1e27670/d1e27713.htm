The limited partners have a 99.99 percent equity interest in the limited tax credit partnership. Paragraph 78 of Statement 14, as amended, requires any equity interest of the minority participants to be reported as restricted net position, nonexpendable; however, paragraph 9 of Statement 63 requires the net investment in capital assets component of net position to include capital assets, net of accumulated depreciation, reduced by outstanding obligations that are attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement of those assets. How should the components of net position be classified if the limited tax credit partnership holds capital assets that will revert to the housing authority?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Statement 34, as amended, and Statement 63 do not establish a prioritization for the calculation of the components of net position. Because the housing authority’s legal ownership is limited to 0.01 percent of the net position of the limited tax credit partnership, the housing authority should first calculate its 0.01 percent of each component of net position and then report the remaining 99.99 percent of net position as restricted net position, nonexpendable.</div></body></html>
