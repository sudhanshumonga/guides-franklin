Do these FTRs (also referred to as fixed transmission rights, transmission congestion contracts, and congestion revenue rights) meet the definition of a derivative instrument?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—FTRs are financial contracts issued by system operators designed to mitigate variability in transmission costs by equalizing the difference in two “locational marginal pricing” points along the electricity grid through a payment. System operators manage or own regional power distribution either as independent service operators or regional transmission organizations. Many FTRs have characteristics that represent settlement factors, leverage, and net settlement. An FTR that has all of the characteristics of a derivative instrument should be reported as a derivative instrument. FTRs that satisfy the characteristics of a derivative instrument may meet the criteria to be considered normal purchases or normal sales contracts. See Question <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch10_q_a_statement_53_question_22">10.8.8</span>.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Settlement factors. </b>FTRs are usually for a specific amount of electricity, and payments are based on the difference between two distinct locational marginal pricing points. Such FTRs have “one or more reference rates and one or more notional amounts” (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.7">paragraph 7a</span> of Statement 53), meeting the settlement factors characteristic.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Leverage. </b>FTRs may be purchased and sold through auction in a market that the system operator facilitates. In this market, both utilities and investors participate in buying and selling FTRs. The utility should determine whether the amount paid in the auction is “an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors” (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.7">paragraph 7b</span> of Statement 53), meeting the leverage characteristic. If a system operator allocates FTRs to a utility without cost, the allocation requires no initial net investment by the utility <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">in the FTR</b> and such FTRs would meet the leverage characteristic. However, a utility may transfer rights to use, or ownership of, physical transmission facilities to a system operator in exchange for FTRs. Such a transfer could represent a substantial investment in the FTRs and, thus, the leverage characteristic normally would not be met. FTRs received in such an exchange could continue to be provided in future periods. If a system operator continues to provide FTRs in the future, those FTRs should be evaluated to determine whether they constitute payments under an exchange transaction representing a substantial investment in transmission facilities by the utility. That investment would result in the FTRs not meeting the leverage characteristic and, therefore, the FTRs would not be a derivative instrument. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Net settlement. </b>FTRs may be settled by either paying or receiving cash or a commodity. The value of the settlement represents the difference between the two locational marginal pricing points in the contract. If the contract can be settled in cash, the FTRs meet the net settlement characteristic in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.13">paragraph 13a</span> of Statement 53. However, if the FTRs are required to be settled through the transfer of a commodity, such as electricity, the government should determine whether that commodity could be “readily convertible to cash,” for example, through a commodity exchange (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.13">paragraph 13c</span> of Statement 53). If the commodity can be readily converted to cash, the FTRs meet the net settlement characteristic.</div></body></html>
