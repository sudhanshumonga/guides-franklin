The government received a grant from a private foundation and used the grant proceeds to purchase equipment for that activity. How should the grant be reported in the enterprise fund&#39;s financial statements? How should it be reported in the government&#39;s statement of activities?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—In the enterprise fund, the answer depends on whether the grant is restricted for capital purposes. In the statement of activities, the answer depends on whether the grant was restricted to the specific activity. If the grant was not restricted for capital purposes but could have been used for any purpose within the activity, the government should report the grant as <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">nonoperating revenue</b> in the enterprise fund. On the other hand, if the grant was restricted to capital purposes, it would be reported as a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">capital contribution</b> in the enterprise fund&#39;s statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in fund net position, as illustrated in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._101">paragraph 101</span> of Statement 34, as amended. If the grant was restricted to that specific activity (or function), the government would report it as program revenue (either operating or capital, as appropriate) in the statement of activities. If it was not restricted to that activity (or function), the grant would be reported as general revenue in the statement of activities.</div></body></html>
