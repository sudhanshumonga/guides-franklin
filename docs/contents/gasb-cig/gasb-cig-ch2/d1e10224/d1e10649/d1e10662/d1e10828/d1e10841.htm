A participant&#39;s equity in an internal cash management or investment pool should not be considered cash unless the participant is able to withdraw cash at any time without prior notice or penalty. (Footnote 5 of Statement 9 acknowledges that cash includes &quot;deposits in other kinds of accounts or cash management pools that have the general characteristics of demand deposit accounts in that the governmental enterprise may deposit additional cash at any time and also effectively may withdraw cash at any time without prior notice or penalty.&quot;) If the pool is not liquid enough to enable a participant to make such demands on the pool, the participant is not able to use its equity in the pool as a demand deposit account. Stated another way, an investment pool should be evaluated as if it were a mutual fund. To some extent, the pool&#39;s investments affect the ability of participants to use the pool as a demand deposit account. Also important are the number of participants and the likelihood that their withdrawals could overburden the pool. For cash flow reporting purposes, the equity in a pool that is not sufficiently liquid to enable withdrawal without prior notice or penalty should be treated as an investment.</div></body></html>
