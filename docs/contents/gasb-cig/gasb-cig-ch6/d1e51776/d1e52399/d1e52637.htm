That land generally is referred to as <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">trust land</b>. The income from that land is dedicated to the support of public education; however, some of the land also is used for other purposes (for example, recreation). The state elects to treat the trust land as one unit of account. Does the trust land meet the definition of an investment?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Because the state government has determined the unit of account to be the entire trust land and some of the land is used for other purposes (for example, recreation), the land’s service capacity is not based solely on its ability to generate cash or to be sold to generate cash. If the state government instead had determined the unit of account to be each individual parcel of land, the government should classify each parcel on the basis of whether the individual parcel meets the definition of an investment.</div></body></html>
