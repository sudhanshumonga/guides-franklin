Prepayments by the obligees of the underlying assets reduce the total interest payments to be received by holders of the asset-backed investments. Generally when interest rates fall, obligees tend to prepay the assets (for example, mortgagees prepaying mortgages to take advantage of the lower rates through refinancing), thus eliminating the stream of interest payments that would have been received under the original amortization schedule. This reduced cash flow diminishes the fair value of the asset-backed investment. However, if the asset-backed investment is not able to be prepaid, it is less likely to be susceptible to interest rate changes. </div></body></html>
