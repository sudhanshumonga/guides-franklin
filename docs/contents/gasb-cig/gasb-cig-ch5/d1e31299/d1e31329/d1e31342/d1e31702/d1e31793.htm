If (a) a separate account is maintained for each of the governments or (b) a separate account is maintained for the state and its component units together and separate accounts are maintained for each of the other governments, such that the assets in each of the separate accounts legally are available to pay the benefits of only the employees of the government or governments whose assets are maintained in the separate account, the plan would be classified as an agent multiple-employer plan. If, instead, the pension plan assets legally can be used to pay the benefits of the employees of any of the governments, the plan would be classified as a cost-sharing multiple-employer plan.</div></body></html>
