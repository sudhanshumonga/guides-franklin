First, the assets should be managed using an asset management system that meets the criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#modified_approach_rec1">paragraph 23</span> of Statement 34. Second, the government should document that the assets are being preserved at or above a condition level established by the government as required by <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._24">paragraph 24</span> of that Statement. Under the modified approach, depreciation expense is not recorded for these assets. Rather, costs for both maintenance and preservation of these assets should be expensed in the period incurred. Additions and improvements, on the other hand, are capitalized.
