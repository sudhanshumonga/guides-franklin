For example, if a government can determine the historical cost of infrastructure assets in its road network acquired since 1970, can it report those assets only, or would it then be required to determine the historical cost (or estimate those costs) for assets acquired since 1970 for all other infrastructure networks? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The 1980 date in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#initial_capitalization_of_general_infrastructure_assets_rec1">paragraph 154</span> of Statement 34 is set as a minimum threshold for reporting infrastructure assets. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._156">Paragraph 156</span> of that Statement encourages reporting nonmajor networks, and <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_434">Question 7.106.4</span> encourages reporting assets or portions of assets acquired prior to the 1980 date. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._150">Paragraphs 150 and 151</span> of Statement 34 indicate that partial reporting of infrastructure should be done on a network-by-network basis. For example, it would be permissible to report for the road network all assets acquired after 1970 and to report for the dam network only those assets acquired after 1980. It would not be permissible, however, to report the portion of the road or dam networks acquired after 1980 in one year, and then report the portion acquired between 1970 and 1980 in a subsequent year.
