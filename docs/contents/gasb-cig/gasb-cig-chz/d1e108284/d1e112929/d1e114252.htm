The government would be required to take the same action to redeploy those resources to another use. A separate fund is established to account for those resources and their use. The government budgets the entire revenue source in the general fund and annually appropriates a transfer to the separate fund. Can the government report the separate fund as a special revenue fund? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The action taken to limit the use of those resources (the initial action establishing the limitation, not the actions taken to appropriate the transfers) qualifies as a commitment of a specific revenue for a specific purpose. However, notwithstanding the budgetary treatment, the separate fund can be reported as a special revenue fund only if the 20 percent portion is recognized as revenue in the separate fund, rather than in the general fund.
