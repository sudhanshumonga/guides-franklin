The notional amount of the hedging interest rate swap, however, was not reduced. How does the reduction of debt principal affect the hedging relationship?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The notional amount of the hedging interest rate swap is no longer consistent with the hedged bonds. The bonds are now over-hedged. The evaluation of hedge effectiveness would consider only the remaining portion of the swap that is undisturbed by the debt extinguishment. For example, if the latter 2 years of a 10-year bond issue are extinguished, that portion of the deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources that relates to the final 2 years of the hedging interest rate swap should be recognized in investment income in the current reporting period. The remainder of the interest rate swap would become an investment derivative. That portion of the interest rate swap that relates to the extinguished debt should be removed from the hedging relationship. That is, the amount in the deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources that relates to the extinguished debt should be recognized in investment income in the current reporting period.</div></body></html>
