However, as discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#imposition_of_will_rec1">paragraph 25</span> of Statement 14, there are circumstances in which the primary government has little influence over the organization&#39;s operations based on the provisions of law or contract. For that reason, it is necessary to determine whether the primary government has the ability to impose its will on the potential component unit using the criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs14_par._26">paragraph 26</span> of Statement 14. For example, the state governor appoints the local board of civil service commissioners but has no other authority over the board. Therefore, the state does not have the ability to impose its will on the organization. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_imposition_of_will_2_rec1">Question 4.20.1</span> for further discussion of the criteria.)</div></body></html>
