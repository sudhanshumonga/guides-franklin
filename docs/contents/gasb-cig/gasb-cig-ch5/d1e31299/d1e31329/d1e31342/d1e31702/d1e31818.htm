For certain employers (“nonpool employers”), the PERS maintains separate asset accounts. The assets and obligations of other employers (“pool employers”) are pooled. How should this arrangement be classified for purposes of applying Statement 67, as amended?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—If the assets of each of the nonpool employers cannot legally be used to pay benefits to the employees of any other employer, the portion of the trust that is being used to administer benefits to the employees of the nonpool employers is a separate (agent multiple-employer) plan. In this circumstance, the portion of the trust that is being used to administer the benefits of the employees of pool employers is a cost-sharing multiple-employer plan. If, however, the assets in the trust may legally be used to pay benefits to the employees of any of the employers (pooled or nonpooled), the trust should be reported as one cost-sharing multiple-employer plan.</div></body></html>
