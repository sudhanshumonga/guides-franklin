The seven-member governing board of the foundation is appointed by the university board of trustees and may be removed for cause. The university provides office space free of charge, but the majority of the funding for the foundation&#39;s operations is provided by its fund-raising efforts. The foundation selects its own management and controls its day-to-day operations. All of the foundation&#39;s projects benefit the university, but the foundation board specifies the use of foundation funds.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The foundation would be a blended component unit of the university. The university appoints the foundation&#39;s board of trustees and receives financial benefits from the foundation, which creates financial accountability. The foundation provides services entirely to the university, which would meet the criteria for blending.</div></body></html>
