The bond indenture includes a requirement to provide to the trustee a financial statement showing the coverage of the pledged revenues to the operating expenses of the facilities. Is the university required to make the segment disclosures set forth in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#segment_information__rec1">paragraph 122</span> of Statement 34, as amended? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Paragraph 122, as amended, states that an activity is a segment if its revenues, expenses, gains and losses, and assets and liabilities are required to be accounted for separately. Therefore, because the requirement in this case is limited to only revenues and expenses, the university would not be required to make segment disclosures for its food service operations.</div></body></html>
