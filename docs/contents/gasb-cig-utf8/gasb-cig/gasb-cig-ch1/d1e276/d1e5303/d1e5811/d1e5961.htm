IO tranches pay owners only some part of the interest paid on mortgages (in the case of a collateralized mortgage obligation) in the underlying pool. Consequently, the fair value of an IO tranche is based on the cash flows associated with the interest payments on the outstanding mortgages that make up the underlying pool. In falling interest rate environments, the underlying mortgages are subject to a higher propensity of prepayment by homeowners who are taking advantage of lower rates to refinance their mortgages. Prepayment of the underlying mortgages causes the fair value of the IO to decline on account of the decrease in interest cash flows caused by the prepayments. The risk of prepayment in IO tranches is so significant that the investor in the IO tranche may not be able to recover any portion of the initial investment, and the fair value of the tranche may decline to zero. The severity of the potential fair value loss associated with IO tranches leads them to be classified as investments highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.</div></body></html>
