Further, if one wing is closed and it can be sold or leased under a capital lease to the state or a commercial enterprise at carrying value or more, should the school district report an impairment loss? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>When the school district closes one wing of the school, a change in manner or expected duration of use has occurred, and the school should be evaluated for impairment. Because the wing of the school will not continue to be used, it should be reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value. If the fair value of the capital asset is above its allocated carrying value, as in the example above, no impairment loss would be reported.</div></body></html>
