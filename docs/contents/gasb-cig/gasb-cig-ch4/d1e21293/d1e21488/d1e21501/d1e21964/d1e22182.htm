For example, some states have placed certain general purpose governments under the state&#39;s direct control. In those situations, the state&#39;s authority can include the authority to approve the budget and set tax rates for the local government, which would normally create a fiscal dependency relationship between the governments. However, because of the specific exclusion in footnote 3, the general purpose government would continue to report as a primary government.</div></body></html>
