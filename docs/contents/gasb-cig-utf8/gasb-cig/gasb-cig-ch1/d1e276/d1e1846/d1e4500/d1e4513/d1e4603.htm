The settlement date is the date on which the investment securities are delivered or received in exchange for the cash payment. In purchases and sales of investment securities, it is normal for the order to be made on one day and settled at a later date. Governments should follow trade date accounting. Trade date accounting results in differences between the investment securities accounted for and the investment securities that are exposed to custodial credit risk. Under trade date accounting, the government accounts for investment securities that have been ordered, even though the government has given no consideration and the investment securities remain in the possession of the counterparty pending settlement. Unsettled purchases are exposed to custodial credit risk only to the extent that the counterparty holds a deposit or margin account against them. A government using trade date accounting also may have relieved its investment account of unsettled sales. Even though the government is not exposed to market risk on those investment securities, it still is exposed to custodial credit risk that could result in losses before settlement. Therefore, preparers using trade date accounting should consider making disclosures of investment securities sold but not yet settled in determining custodial credit risk disclosures.</div></body></html>
