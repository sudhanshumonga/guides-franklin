The volume of electricity encompassed by the futures contracts cannot be rapidly sold in its entirety without significantly affecting the quoted price of the contracts. Do market price changes due to volume affect whether there is a market mechanism that facilitates the net settlement characteristic as described in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.13">paragraph 13b</span> of Statement 53?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Whether the volume of electricity covered by the group of futures contracts exceeds the volume that could rapidly be absorbed by the market without significantly affecting the price in this situation is not relevant to applying the criterion in paragraph 13b. The possible reduction in price due to selling a large futures position is not considered a transaction cost under this criterion. A financial instrument also may meet the net settlement characteristic if (a) neither party is required to deliver an asset associated with the reference rate that has a denomination that is equal to the notional amount of the financial instrument (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.13">paragraph 13a</span> of Statement 53) or (b) a delivered asset, for example, a bond, is readily convertible to cash (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.13">paragraph 13c</span> of Statement 53 and <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch10_q_a_statement_53_question_14">Question 10.6.6</span>).</div></body></html>
