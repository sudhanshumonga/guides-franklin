In its separate financial statements, the university (legally separate from the state) reports as a BTA, pursuant to the provisions of <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._138">paragraph 138</span> in Statement 34, as amended. If the university chooses to present the foundation&#39;s financial statements in a separate column adjacent to its own total columns, what display and classification modifications to the foundation&#39;s financial statements may be necessary?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—If the foundation’s statement of net assets is not presented in a classified format, its assets and liabilities should be reclassified into their current and noncurrent components, based generally on the guidance in Statement 62, paragraphs 29–44, as amended. Also, the foundation’s net assets should be redistributed among the three net position components required in Statement No. 63, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Financial Reporting of Deferred Outflows of Resources, Deferred Inflows of Resources, and Net Position</b>—net investment in capital assets, restricted (distinguishing between expendable and nonexpendable and between major categories of restrictions), and unrestricted. The data in the foundation’s statement of activities may need to be realigned to distinguish between operating and nonoperating revenues and expenses and generally relocated to their appropriate positions in the GASB’s required format. Also, because the university can present its operating expenses by either natural classification or functional categories, the foundation’s expenses may need to be reconfigured to conform to the approach used by the university. In addition, the foundation’s revenues may need to be reduced by related discounts and allowances, if reported separately as expenses, to be consistent with the university’s presentation.
