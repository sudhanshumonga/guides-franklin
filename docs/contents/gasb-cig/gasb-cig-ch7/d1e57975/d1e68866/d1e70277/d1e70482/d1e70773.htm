Normally, these distributions are for a fixed dollar amount (annuity trust) or a fixed percentage of the trust&#39;s fair market value (unitrust). The more common types of split-interest agreements operate similarly.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The public institution should recognize an asset for the fair value of the trust assets and a liability for the obligation to the beneficiary, with the difference between the asset and liability recognized as gift revenue. Changes (for example, changes in actuarial assumptions, revaluations of the present value of the trust assets, or adjustments to discount amortization) should be reflected in the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position or the statement of activities, depending upon the special-purpose government reporting format used by the public institution. Upon termination of the trust, either through death or through expiration of the trust term, the liability should be removed with the offset to a change in the value of the trust in the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position or the statement of activities.</div></body></html>
