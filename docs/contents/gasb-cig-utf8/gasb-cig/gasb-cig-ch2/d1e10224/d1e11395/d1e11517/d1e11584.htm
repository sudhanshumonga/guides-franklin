Similarly, subsequent principal and interest payments on the refunding debt should also be reported as cash outflows in the capital category. If the refunding issue is in excess of the amount needed to refund the existing capital debt, the total proceeds and the subsequent principal and interest payments should be allocated between the capital category and the noncapital financing category based on the amounts used for capital and noncapital purposes.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the new bonds result in an in-substance defeasance and cash flows actually occur (see <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_2_question_23" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_2_question_23">Question 2.15.3</span>), there should be symmetry in reporting the cash flows related to the refunding. The outflow to a trustee or fiscal agent to defease the debt should be presented in the same category as the debt service payment on the old debt. The proceeds should be classified as an inflow of the same category. The new debt assumes the characteristics of the old debt. Subsequently, the new debt issue should be classified in the same manner as the defeased debt. For example, if the original debt was for capital purposes, the new debt should be considered capital debt.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">However, paragraph 29c explains that an entire refunding issue may not assume the characteristics of the old debt if the refunding debt exceeds the amount needed to defease the existing debt. If debt is issued for a dual purpose—to defease a noncapital debt issue and to finance new construction, for example—it should be allocated according to its purposes. The portion required to defease the old debt assumes the characteristics of the old debt. The remainder should be evaluated according to its purpose and is classified appropriately. (In this case, the remainder would be classified as a capital financing activity.)
