The property owners have responsibility for maintaining sidewalks adjacent to streets. They decide what maintenance will be performed, and when. They are financially responsible for maintenance, including potential liabilities for failure to perform maintenance. The city&#39;s actions to establish regulations governing minimum standards for sidewalks should not be considered taking responsibility for managing the sidewalk. Therefore, the city should not report the sidewalks.</div></body></html>
