This compares favorably with the State's rate of 4.4 percent and the national rate of 4.9 percent.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Inflation in the metropolitan area continues to be somewhat higher than the national consumer price index due in part to the residential housing market and energy price increases.</div><div class="p ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–City inflation was 3.2 percent for fiscal year 20X2.</div><div class="p ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–The average US city rate was 3 percent.</div><div class="p ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–The national rate was 2.8 percent.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">These indicators were taken into account when adopting the general fund budget for 20X3. Amounts available for appropriation in the general fund budget are $96.4 million, an increase of 3.1 percent over the final 20X2 budget of $93.5 million. Property taxes (benefiting from the 2012 rate increases and increases in assessed valuations), public service taxes (with rate increases discussed above), and grant revenue (boosted by increased state funding in several of our current programs) are expected to lead this increase. The City will use these increases in revenues to finance programs we currently offer and the expected impact of inflation on program costs.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Budgeted expenditures are expected to rise nearly 4 percent to $95.9 million. The largest increments are increased wages and cost-of-living adjustments of $800,000 based on agreements reached with the police, fire, and sanitation department unions in 20X2. The City has added no major new programs or initiatives to the 20X3 budget.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">If these estimates are realized, the City's budgetary general fund balance is expected to increase modestly by the close of 20X3. More importantly, however, this will have been accomplished without repeating the selling of capital assets or restructuring of long-term debt to alleviate cash flow pressures that occurred this year. In addition, the City recently purchased commercial insurance for all property and casualty claims incurred after December 31, 20X2.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">As for the City's business-type activities, we expect that the 20X3 results will also improve based on these recent rate decisions:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•The Public Service Commission approved a 2 percent rate increase for all water customers effective January 1. Sewer charges will not change.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The City Council authorized a 15 percent increase in parking fees at the City-owned garages and on-street meters.</div></body></html>
