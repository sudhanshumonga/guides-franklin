If, for example, a lottery purchases an annuity in a prize winner's name and the transaction meets the requirements for right of setoff, the purchase should be considered an operating activities cash outflow (as though it paid the prize winner directly). If, on the other hand, a lottery purchases a series of investments, such as federal Treasury STRIPS, in its own name to allow it to service its prize awards as they come due, there are (at least) three cash flows to report. The purchase of the STRIPS and the proceeds received at maturity are investing activities cash flows. The cash payment to the prize winner is an operating activities cash flow.
