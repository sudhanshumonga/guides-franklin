If the entity’s regulator concludes that fair value increases and decreases should not affect utility rates in the current reporting period, those increases and decreases may, nevertheless, be reported as required by Statement 31, as amended, and Statement 72. If this approach is used, fair value increases and decreases should then be reversed at the end of the flows statement (for example, the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position) using a heading such as “Net costs to be recovered from future billings,” and the applicable provisions of paragraphs <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb_op_gasb_62_general_standards_of_accounting_for_the_effects_of_regulation">480-483</span> of Statement 62, as amended, should be applied. Those increases and decreases that do not affect utility rates in the current period may instead be reported in the statement of net position as regulatory amounts under the applicable provisions of paragraphs 480-483 of Statement 62, as amended, without being reported in the flows statement.</div></body></html>
