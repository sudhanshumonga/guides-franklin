Should rent be classified as an operating activity or as some other activity in the statement of cash flows?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—As discussed in Question 2.18.1, the classification of a transaction for operating statement purposes should not dictate its classification in the statement of cash flows. Therefore, the basic question is whether rent income meets the classification criteria of the noncapital financing category, the capital and related financing category, or the investing activities category. If not, the cash flows should be classified in the operating activities category because that is the residual category. Rent income is not specifically addressed in Statement 9; however, that should not necessarily lead one to categorize rent as an “operating activity.” The characteristics of the rent-generating asset should be examined.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The definition of the investing activities category does not specifically address the possibility of an investment being a tangible capital asset such as land; however, the list of investments described is not intended to be all-encompassing. If the land or other capital asset generating the rent meets the definition of an investment in paragraph 64 of Statement 72, rent should be classified as an investing activity. Reporting the rent-generating asset in the statement of net position as an investment rather than a capital asset is evidence that the cash flows should be classified as investing activities.</div></body></html>
