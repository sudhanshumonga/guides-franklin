If legally permissible, reporting identities of the largest payers (remitters) without their remittance obligations liabilities might still assist this aim. However, when considering what alternative information to provide, governments should be mindful that the central objective of this information is to provide insights into the degree to which a government is or is not reliant upon a small number of significant payers (remitters).</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The amount paid or the portion of the revenue base accounted for by each of the principal payers (remitters) and their percentages of the total are the key pieces of information for assessing a government&#39;s reliance on a small number of payers (remitters). If allowed, a government might report those key pieces of information for the largest payers (remitters) without specifically identifying who they are.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the key pieces of information cannot legally be presented, then a government should consider what other information would convey to the user a sense of the degree of concentration in an own-source revenue among particular kinds of payers (remitters).
