The services of the corporation are not available to individuals that are not affiliated with the university. The corporation is governed by a board of directors appointed by the university. The majority of the funding for the corporation is provided by tuition and fees paid by those using the daycare services. Day-to-day operations are controlled by a director, who is selected by the board. The corporation adopts its own budget. However, through a contractual arrangement with the university, the corporation operates as a department of the university. In the past, capital assets have been financed through no-interest loans from the university to the corporation, which were forgiven through an agreement between the parties.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The corporation would either be a discretely presented component unit of the university or be disclosed as a related organization. The university appoints the governing board of the corporation. If the past financing of capital assets indicates a potential financial burden on the university, then the corporation should be reported as a discretely presented component unit. However, if there is not a potential financial burden, the university would not be financially accountable for the center and it would be disclosed as a related organization of the university.</div></body></html>
