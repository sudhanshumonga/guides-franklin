As amended, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#recognition_and_reporting_rec1">paragraph 13</span> of Statement 31, including footnote 7, describes how to report fair value changes in the financial statements; realized gains and losses generally should not be displayed separately from the net increase (decrease) in the fair value of investments. Premiums and discounts generally should not be amortized. However, those provisions apply only to investments that are reported using fair value. Paragraph 13, as amended, does not modify current reporting practices for investments that are reported using cost-based measures, including the reporting of realized gains and losses and the amortization of premiums and discounts. If that presentation for cost-based investment income is retained, the financial statements should clearly indicate that this presentation applies only to securities reported at amortized cost.</div></body></html>
