The authority provides electrical power to the cities at a rate that provides sufficient revenue to enable the authority to pay its operating expenses and principal and interest on its debt. The four cities have an equity interest in the assets and liabilities of the authority, proportional to the total contributions received from each municipality since the authority was organized. The cities report their equity interests in enterprise funds. The power authority is governed by an eight-member board. The city council of each city appoints two members to the board. The authority approves its own budget, can issue debt and hold title to property in its own name, and controls its day-to-day operations.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> This power authority is a joint venture with equity interests. It is a separate legal entity and none of the four participating governments appoints a voting majority of the governing board. Each of the governments has an ongoing financial interest in the authority based on their contributions to the organization. Each of the four participating cities should calculate its total equity in accordance with the joint venture agreement and report the amount as an asset of the enterprise fund.</div></body></html>
