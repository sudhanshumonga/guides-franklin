Generally, when the university awards a scholarship to a student who meets the criteria established by the alumni association, the university requests funds from the alumni association&#39;s resources. Normally, the alumni association honors the request and transfers the funds to the university. In the current year, the alumni association endows a chair and 14 scholarships for the KMH University School of Business and donates the funds to KMH University. The funds donated directly to the university and the resources held by the association are significant to the university&#39;s financial statements.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>KMH University Alumni Association is a component unit of the university and should be discretely presented in the university&#39;s reporting entity financial statements. The alumni association&#39;s resources are entirely for the direct benefit of the university or the university&#39;s students. The &quot;entitlement/ability to access&quot; criterion is met because the association historically has complied with the university&#39;s requests for funding. In addition, the resources received and held by the association that are required to be used for the benefit of the university or to provide scholarships to deserving students are significant to the university.</div></body></html>
