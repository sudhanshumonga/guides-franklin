The bridge condition rating is a numerical condition scale ranging from 1 (impaired or load restricted) to 7 (new). A bridge is considered &quot;deficient&quot;—that is, needs maintenance or preservation—when its condition falls below 5. A bridge is unsafe—impaired or load restricted—when it falls below condition level 2. It is the State&#39;s policy to keep the number and square footage of deck area of unsafe bridges below 1 percent. The most recent condition assessment shows that the condition of the State&#39;s bridges is in accordance with the State&#39;s policy. Actual maintenance and preservation costs were less than estimated by approximately 12 percent. Due to an unusually mild winter in the previous year, less maintenance and preservation efforts were necessary to keep the State&#39;s bridges at or above the established condition level.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> Governments should also present the information in the following schedules, derived from the asset management system, as required supplementary information for all eligible infrastructure assets that are reported using the modified approach.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_110" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> (<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div></body></html>
