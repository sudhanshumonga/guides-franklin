However, because the major fund criteria focus on assets plus deferred outflows of resources and liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">separately,</b> significant interfund balances could influence the outcome of the major fund test. Interfund balances should not be eliminated, but if there are significant interfund receivables and payables, governments may adopt a policy (and use it consistently from year to year) to use a single “net” amount for each fund. Those changes would carry over to the respective total columns so that the governmental and enterprise fund totals would include the combined “net” amounts from the individual funds. Use of the “netting” process discussed in this answer should be limited to the determination of major funds. It should not be used for fund financial statement reporting purposes.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">In the fund operating statements, transfers in and transfers out are not included in the major fund calculation (revenues and expenditures/expenses) and do not affect the major funds determination because they are reported as other financing sources (uses). Interfund services provided and used are not distinguished from other revenues or expenditures/expenses.</div></body></html>
