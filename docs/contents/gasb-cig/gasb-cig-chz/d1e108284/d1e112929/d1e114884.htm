The board resolution stipulates that the resources set aside “cannot be used for any other purposes.” Should that portion of fund balance be classified as committed? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Purpose</b> refers to the objects of spending or usage, rather than circumstances. That is, purpose limitations establish what fund balance can be spent for, not the circumstances under which the resources can be spent. In this case, because the amount set aside can be spent for any appropriated purpose, the stipulation that those resources cannot be spent for any other purpose does not constitute a limitation and the resources should be included in the unassigned category. The arrangement in this example possesses the characteristic of a minimum fund balance policy, and if so, the county should make the disclosures required in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs54_par.27">paragraph 27</span> of Statement 54.</div></body></html>
