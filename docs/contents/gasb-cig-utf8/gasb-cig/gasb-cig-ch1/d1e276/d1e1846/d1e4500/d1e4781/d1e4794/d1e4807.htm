What is the difference between an open-end mutual fund and a closed-end mutual fund?

An open-end mutual fund creates new shares to meet investor demand; a closed-end fund has a constant number of shares. The value of an investment in an open-end fund depends directly on the value of the underlying portfolio; the value of an investment in a closed-end fund depends on the market supply and demand for the shares rather than directly on the value of the company's portfolio. An open-end mutual fund generally does not issue certificates; instead, it sends out periodic statements showing deposits, withdrawals, and dividends credited to the investor's account. A closed-end fund does issue certificates, and the securities are traded on a stock exchange. Statement 3 uses the term <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">mutual fund</b> to refer to an open-end fund.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">A unit investment trust also holds a diversified portfolio of securities. Unlike a mutual fund, the portfolio of an investment trust is fixed; once structured, it is not actively managed, except for some limited surveillance. That is, cash received from income and maturing investments is not reinvested but is distributed to shareholders of the trust. Unit investment trust shares are securities and are traded.</div></body></html>
