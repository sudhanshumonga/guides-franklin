The city intends to place the amount owed for the accrued interest in an escrow account. Should the accrued interest on the old debt before the advanced refunding be included in the reacquisition price for advance refunding? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Any interest accrued up until the date of refunding represents a liability that is separate from the refunding of the old debt and, thus, should be recorded in interest expense. Accrued interest on the old debt may be included in the reacquisition price for advance refunding. If that is done, the net carrying amount (footnote 4 of Statement 23, as amended) should include a like amount. Alternatively, the government could omit in the reacquisition price any amounts placed in an escrow account that pertain to the interest accrued on the old debt before the advanced refunding. Only the amount placed in the escrow account, including future interest earnings, that is necessary to pay interest and principal on the old debt and the call premium once the debt is advance refunded would be included in the reacquisition price. If this alternative is selected, the net carrying amount would not include a like amount.</div></body></html>
