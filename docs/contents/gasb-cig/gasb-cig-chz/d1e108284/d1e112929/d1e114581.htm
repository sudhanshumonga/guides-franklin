It can pass ordinances, resolutions, and take “other” council actions. Because the city council is the highest level of decision-making authority in this example, do all of those actions constitute commitments? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Only the action that constitutes the most binding constraint should be considered a commitment for fund balance classification purposes. The most binding constraint is that which presents the greatest limitation on redeployment of those resources for other purposes. For example, if an ordinance becomes part of the city code and resolutions confirm and memorialize council decisions, the ordinance represents the most binding action that can be taken to impose spending constraints and therefore would give rise to committed fund balance.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">However, if an ordinance only differs from a resolution by the process through which it is passed or the form in which it is memorialized, and the extent to which they bind the government is essentially the same, then both forms of decision-making authority are equally binding and meet the criteria to establish a fund balance commitment.</div></body></html>
