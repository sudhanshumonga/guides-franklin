Different investment terms and risks are features that give investments differing forms. For example, a government may hold two U.S. Treasury investments, one a 10-year bond and the other an interest-only strip. Although both are U.S. Treasury securities, they exhibit significantly different risk characteristics. By not prescribing investment types, practitioners are able to apply professional judgment and select investment types that fit the facts and circumstances; however, investments with significantly different risk profiles should not be aggregated into a single investment type.</div></body></html>
