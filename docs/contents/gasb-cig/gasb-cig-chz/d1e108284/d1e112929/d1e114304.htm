Each year the council includes an amount to be transferred into a special fund created for that specific purpose. How should the separate fund be reported?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The fund does not meet the criteria to be reported as a separate special revenue fund because the transferred amounts do not represent restricted or committed revenues. In addition, property revaluation does not meet the purpose criteria for reporting as a capital projects fund. Consequently, for financial statement reporting purposes, the activities of the separate fund would either be presented with the general fund or included within a qualifying special revenue fund with a similar purpose.</div></body></html>
