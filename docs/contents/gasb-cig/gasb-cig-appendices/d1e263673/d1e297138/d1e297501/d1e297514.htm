Exhibits 8 and 9 illustrate two different approaches for the combined statement of governmental fund revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances/statement of activities. If the explanations for the reconciliation items in the &quot;Adjustments&quot; column are not provided on the face of the statement, they are required to be disclosed in the notes. Even if the explanations <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">are</b> provided on the face of the statement, it still may be necessary to provide additional disclosure of certain items as required by <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#required_reconciliation_to_government-wide_statements_rec1">paragraph 77</span> of Statement 34.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Using a combination approach for the statement of activities requires the reporting government to reformat either the statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances or the statement of activities. In Exhibit 8 the governmental fund statement is modified to align with the statement of activities. Exhibit 9 realigns the statement of activities to be compatible with the fund financial statement format. Neither format is preferred over the other, but financial statement preparers who choose to use a combination method should consider the significance of program revenues in determining which format best suits their particular situation. (When program revenues are negligible, as they are in this example, the format of Exhibit 9 might provide more useful information. On the other hand, significant program revenues may support using the net cost format illustrated in Exhibit 8.)</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Preparers should also consider that there is a difference in the &quot;message&quot; communicated to the users depending on the format used. In Exhibit 8 the message might be interpreted as &quot;this is how we paid for the cost of the program&quot;; the message from the approach in Exhibit 9 could be &quot;this is what we did with the revenues we raised.&quot;</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_100" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span>(<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_101" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> (<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_102" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> (<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div></body></html>
