Its governing board consists of five members-four appointed by the mayor of the city and one appointed by the board of county commissioners. The board members may not be removed by the appointing officials, except for cause through an impeachment process.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The authority is authorized to issue bonds, to levy taxes, to own property in its own name, to determine its budget, and to establish rates. All debt issued is payable from revenues derived solely from the operation of the authority. The city has no obligation for the debt of the authority. The authority&#39;s board controls the day-to-day operations of the organization. The authority has sole responsibility for financing its deficits and has sole control of its surplus funds.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The airport authority is not a component unit of the city; however, because city officials appoint a voting majority of the authority&#39;s board, the authority should be disclosed as a related organization. The city cannot impose its will on the authority and there is not a financial benefit or burden relationship between the two governments; therefore, the city is not financially accountable for the airport authority.</div></body></html>
