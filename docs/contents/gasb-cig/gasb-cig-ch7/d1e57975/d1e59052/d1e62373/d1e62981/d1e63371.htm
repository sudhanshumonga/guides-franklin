If the project is financed with bond proceeds, the amount of the retainage is attributed to the construction in progress, and would be included in the net investment in capital assets component of net position. The unspent bond proceeds together with the portion of the debt attributable to the unspent proceeds would be included in the restricted component of net position calculation. (Generally, debt issuance does not create net position; therefore, a portion of the debt will be netted against remaining investments.) Thus, “capital-related debt” in this situation includes the portion of the bonds payable that has been spent on the capital construction, plus retainages and accounts payable attributable to that construction.</div></body></html>
