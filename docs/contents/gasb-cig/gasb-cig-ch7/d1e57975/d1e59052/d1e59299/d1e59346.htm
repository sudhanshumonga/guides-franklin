How should the pension obligation bonds be reported?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The pension obligation bonds should be reported as a governmental activities liability (bonds payable) in the statement of net position. If the pensions are within the scope of Statement 68, to the extent that the contribution is reported as an addition to the pension plan’s fiduciary net position, the net pension liability would be reduced by the amount of the bond proceeds remitted to the pension plan through the measurement date, and a deferred outflow of resources related to pensions would be reported for the amount of proceeds remitted to the pension plan subsequent to the measurement date. If the proceeds are instead used to satisfy a payable to the defined benefit pension plan, the payable would be reduced by amounts remitted to the pension plan through the employer’s fiscal year-end. If any proceeds of the bonds have not been remitted to the pension plan, they should be included in the governmental activities assets. If the pensions are within the scope of Statement 73, any bond proceeds that have not been used to make benefit payments should be included in the governmental activities assets.</div></body></html>
