Annuity payments are calculated at the employee’s retirement date based on mortality tables and an interest rate established by the pension plan’s administrative board. The total amount of payments received is not otherwise limited by the amounts in the employee’s account—that is, if the employee lives longer than projected at retirement, benefit payments continue at the amount calculated at retirement until the employee’s death. Is the pension defined contribution or defined benefit for financial reporting purposes?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The pension is defined benefit. Although the amount of an employee’s annuity payment is based on the individual account balance at retirement, the total amount of benefits received by the employee does not depend only on &quot;the contributions (or credits) to the employee’s account, actual earnings on investments of those contributions (or credits), and the effects of forfeitures of contributions (or credits) made for other employees, as well as pension plan administrative costs, that are allocated to the employee’s account.&quot; The total amount of benefits also depends on the number of years the employee lives to receive benefit payments. Further, the amount of the benefit payments depends upon the interest rate established by the plan, rather than on actual earnings on the investment of assets in the account. Therefore, the annuitization of the employee’s account balance under the benefit terms results in a pension that does not depend solely on the factors identified in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs68__par__10">paragraph 10c</span> of Statement 68.</div></body></html>
