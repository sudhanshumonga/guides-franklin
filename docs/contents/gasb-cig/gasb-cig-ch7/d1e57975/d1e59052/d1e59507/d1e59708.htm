Although property records may indicate that the capital assets were acquired with federal funds and the federal government retains a reversionary interest in the salvage values of the assets, the state or local government is the party that uses the assets in its activities and makes the decisions regarding when and how the assets will be used and managed. The historical cost of these assets should be reported in the state or local government&#39;s statement of net position, and depreciation expense, if applicable, for these assets should be included in the expenses for the function that uses the assets.</div></body></html>
