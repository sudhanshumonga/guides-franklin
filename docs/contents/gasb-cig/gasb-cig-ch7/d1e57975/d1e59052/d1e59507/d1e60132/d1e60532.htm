Which government reports the road as an infrastructure asset? Which government reports the bonds payable? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—If there is evidence as to which government owns the road, that government should report it. In many circumstances, however, ownership of roads is not clearly evidenced by deed or other legal document that stipulates ownership. For example, title to the land under the road may be held by the owner of the adjoining property, but there is no equivalent title for the road itself. When ownership is unclear, the government with primary responsibility for managing an infrastructure asset should report the asset. In this example, because the state is responsible for maintenance, it would report the asset. However, the county would continue to report the bonds payable because it is legally obligated for repayment.</div></body></html>
