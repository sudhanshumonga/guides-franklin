That paragraph specifies that &quot;the ARC reported for the employer&#39;s current fiscal year should be based on the results of the most recent actuarial valuation, performed in accordance with the parameters as of a date not more than 24 months before the beginning of the first year of the 2-year or 3-year period for which that valuation provides the ARC, if valuations are biennial or triennial.&quot; For example, if an employer applies the alternative measurement method triennially, the ARCs for the employer&#39;s fiscal years ended June 30, 20X5, 20X6, and 20X7, should be based on an application of that method as of July 1, 20X2 (24 months before July 1, 20X4—the beginning date of the first year), or later. Measurements need not be made as of a specific date, but generally should be as of the same date each period in which a valuation is performed.</div></body></html>
