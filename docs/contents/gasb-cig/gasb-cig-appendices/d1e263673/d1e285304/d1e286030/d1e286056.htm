The scholarships are administered by the financial aid office of the university, but awards are approved by the foundation board.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The foundation would be a discretely presented component unit of the university. The university is financially accountable for the foundation based on its appointment of the governing board and the financial benefits that the foundation provides. However, the foundation would not meet the criteria for blending because its services are not provided entirely, or almost entirely, to the university.</div></body></html>
