Presenting the rate structure for a single year would be complex, let alone for the past 10 years. Several options are available to governments in such a circumstance:</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">•The rate information could be presented in more than one schedule. For the income tax described in the question, one schedule might present the rates organized by income brackets and filing status, and a separate schedule might present information about how those rates vary depending on whether the filer is a resident or not.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">•If the impact that a particular characteristic has on rates is uniform across all other characteristics, it could be described in a note. See, for instance, the tax rate information presented in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_C-8">Exhibit C-8</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B9-2 for an illustrative state government. The illustrative government presents the rates for each income bracket that apply to single filers and married filers filing separately. Note c in that exhibit indicates that the rate structure for all other filing statuses can be obtained by doubling the income brackets.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">•If neither of these options is practical, a government should use its professional judgment to select a portion of its rate structure to present, preferably focusing on the characteristics with the most significant impact on determining the rates applied.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">A useful complement to the presentation of complex rate structures, especially if a government presents only a portion of its rate structure, is information about effective rates. The effective rate is an average rate that is calculated by dividing either total revenue or total collections for a given period by the total revenue base for the period. The illustrative state government presents effective rates for its personal income tax in both the revenue base and revenue rate schedules. (It should be noted that, if a government calculates an effective rate for a property tax, the denominator should be the estimated actual taxable value rather than assessed value.)</div></body></html>
