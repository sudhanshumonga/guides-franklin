Paragraph <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs69_par_10">10b</span> of Statement 69, in defining a government merger, provides that the operations of the government entity that ceases to exist are absorbed into, and provided by, one or more continuing governments. Because the operations are continued by a newly formed government, this event would not meet the definition of a government merger. A transfer of operations, as defined in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs69_par_12">paragraph 12</span> of Statement 69, does not require that the transferor government continue to exist after the transfer of operations.</div></body></html>
