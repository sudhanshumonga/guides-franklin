For example, in the discussion of financial burden as a result of a primary government&#39;s obligation in some manner for the debt of an organization, paragraph 33g states that financial burden exists when &quot;previous actions by the primary government related to actual or potential defaults on another organization&#39;s debt make it <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">probable</b> that the primary government will assume responsibility for the debt in the event of default.&quot; The fact that the primary government has entered into an agreement that creates a financial burden may indicate that it would do so again in the future, which would create the potential for financial burden and meet the criteria for inclusion. Professional judgment should be used to determine whether the facts in a given situation manifest financial accountability.</div></body></html>
