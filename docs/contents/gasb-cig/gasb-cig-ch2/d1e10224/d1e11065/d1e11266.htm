The investing cash flows should be presented on the statement of cash flows as if the governmental enterprise were managing the investments. The trustee is managing investments that belong to the governmental enterprise and are held in the name of the governmental enterprise, even though they are restricted. The investment portfolio is presented in the governmental enterprise&#39;s statement of net position/balance sheet, and its performance is presented in the governmental enterprise&#39;s operating statement. This arrangement is different from a cash management or investment pool arrangement, in which a fund manager commingles the assets provided by others. In a pool, each participant owns a share of the pooled assets and their earnings, rather than specific securities.
