At year end, the entire fund balance is classified as restricted. Next year’s budget projects an excess of expenditures over revenues, causing the government to include a portion of existing fund balance as a budgetary resource. Should the amount necessary to balance the budget be classified as assigned? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The amount necessary to balance the budget is already classified as restricted to the purpose for which it is appropriated in the budget. Classifying a portion as <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">assigned</b> understates the restriction on the use of the resources. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs54_par.16">Paragraph 16</span> of Statement 54 provides that appropriating existing fund balance to remedy a budgetary imbalance “satisfies the criteria” to be classified as an assignment; however, that classification would only apply if the amount necessary to balance is expected to come from unassigned fund balance. </div></body></html>
