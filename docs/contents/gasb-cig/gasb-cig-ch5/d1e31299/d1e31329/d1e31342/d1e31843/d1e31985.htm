The cash collected for postemployment healthcare benefits is credited to a liability account in the pension trust fund, which is liquidated when money is remitted to the state agency that administers the postemployment healthcare plan. Should the pension plan instead follow the requirements of Statement 74 for an OPEB plan?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. In collecting and remitting contributions to the agency administering the postemployment healthcare plan, the pension plan’s role in this case is that of an agent (cash conduit). Reporting the cash flow through a liability account in the pension trust fund is an appropriate way of reporting the plan’s involvement. (Agency fund reporting also would fit the circumstances.) The reporting requirements of Statement 74 would apply to fiduciary reporting by the state agency that administers the postemployment healthcare plan.</div></body></html>
