Subsequently, the government uses some of these new (or incremental) tax revenues for a purpose not specified by the enabling legislation. How should the net position generated by the tax be reported?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs46_par._5">Paragraph 5</span> of Statement 46 states that when resources restricted by enabling legislation are used for a purpose other than those set forth by the legislation, the government should reevaluate the legal enforceability of the restrictions. If it determines, in its professional judgment, that the restrictions are no longer legally enforceable, then from that period forward the accumulated resources and the future resources generated by the tax should be reported as unrestricted.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the government determines that the restriction continues to be legally enforceable, the restricted net position should not reflect any reduction related to the use of the restricted resources for purposes not specified by the enabling legislation.

The amount of restricted resources used for purposes not specified by the enabling legislation should be added back to the year-end restricted assets, and the sum should be reduced by reported claims against those assets. This will ensure that the use of restricted resources for purposes not specified by the enabling legislation will be reflected in the unrestricted component of net position rather than the restricted component of net position.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">all</b> of the restricted resources were used for purposes not specified by the enabling legislation (in other words, no assets restricted to the purposes specified by the enabling legislation remain at year-end) and the restriction continues to be legally enforceable, the year-end amount of assets restricted to the purpose specified by the enabling legislation is zero, but the restricted component of net position still should be determined as specified in Question 7.24.8. Beginning with a zero balance of restricted assets, the amount of restricted resources used for purposes not specified is added back (in this instance, all of the restricted resources), and the sum is reduced by reported claims against those assets. </div></body></html>
