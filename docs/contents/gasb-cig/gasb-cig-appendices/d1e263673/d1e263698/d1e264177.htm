Analytical software commonly includes duration functions. Macaulay duration—named after its developer—is the basic calculation developed for a portfolio of bonds assembled to fund a fixed liability. Modified duration—based on Macaulay duration—estimates the sensitivity of a bond&#39;s price to interest rate changes. Effective duration makes assumptions regarding the most likely timing and amounts of variable cash flows arising from such investments as callable bonds, prepayments, and variable-rate debt. Statement 40 does not specify which form of duration method is to be used.</div></body></html>
