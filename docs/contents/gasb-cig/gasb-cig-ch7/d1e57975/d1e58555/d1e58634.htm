Thus, discussion in MD&amp;A generally should be focused on individual component units. However, in some situations discussion of component units in the aggregate may be appropriate. For example, a state university may have multiple fund-raising foundation component units, all of which have virtually identical relationships with the university. The reasoning behind the &quot;individual&quot; focus stipulated in paragraph 10 of Statement 34, and in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs14_par._63">paragraph 63</span> of Statement 14, as amended, is that there generally is a wide variety of relationships that exist in a primary government/component unit setting, and such variety makes discussion and analysis in the aggregate difficult. </div></body></html>
