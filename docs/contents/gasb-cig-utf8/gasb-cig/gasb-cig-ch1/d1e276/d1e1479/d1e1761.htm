Whether or not a debt investment's credit quality rating downgrade is significant to the reporting entity's financial statements calls for the exercise of professional judgment. Restrictions on the types of investments allowed by legal or statutory provisions and by the government's investment policy may prevent a government from having a large credit risk exposure in a single entity's investment (concentration of credit risk). A single investment's downgrade after the date of the financial statements generally may not represent a subsequent event requiring disclosure. However, should a government have a concentration of credit risk in a single investment, credit quality rating downgrades after the date of the financial statements may expose the government to a significantly higher level of credit risk that may require disclosure as a subsequent event. For example, a bond downgraded after the date of the financial statements on account of a bankrupt issuer may indicate a large investment loss for the government. If the value of the investment is significant to the government's total investment portfolio, disclosure of such an event may be required.</div></body></html>
