As such, the primary government can choose to present a blended component unit fund separately or aggregate it with other funds of a similar fund type with the exception of the primary government’s general fund. The combined presentation of the primary government is still subject to major fund considerations and, thus, for example, a blended component unit presented separately as a special revenue fund could represent a major fund for the primary government.
