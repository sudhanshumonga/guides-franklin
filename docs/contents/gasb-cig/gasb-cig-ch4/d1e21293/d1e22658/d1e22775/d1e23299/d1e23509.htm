However, professional judgment should be used to determine whether the restriction is substantive. For example, removal for &quot;inefficiency&quot; could be considered imposing its will, whereas a requirement for due process (public hearings, listing of cause) would generally mitigate the notion that the appointing official has the ability to remove board members at will.</div></body></html>
