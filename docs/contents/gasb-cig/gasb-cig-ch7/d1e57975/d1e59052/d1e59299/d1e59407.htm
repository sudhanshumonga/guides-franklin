For sole and agent employers, Statement 45 requires accrual-basis accounting for OPEB expense with the measurement of expense derived from the annual required contributions, an actuarially computed amount, and disclosure or presentation of information about the plan&#39;s funded status and funding progress and the employer&#39;s contributions in comparison to the calculated annual OPEB cost. For cost-sharing employers, Statement 45 requires measurement of expense based on an employer&#39;s contractually required contribution to the plan and does not require disclosure or presentation of information about the funded status and funding progress of the plan or the employer&#39;s contributions in comparison to annual OPEB cost. For single-employer or agent multiple-employer healthcare plans that cover both active employees and retirees, Statement 45 requires separate accounting for the postemployment benefit portion based on claims costs, or age-adjusted premiums approximating claims costs, for retirees.</div></body></html>
