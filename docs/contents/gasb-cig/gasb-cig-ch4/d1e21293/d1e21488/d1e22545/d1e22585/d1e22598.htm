What is this term intended to encompass?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Paragraph 19 clarifies that Statement 14 does not modify the fund reporting requirements of the primary government. A primary government would continue to report its fiduciary funds regardless of whether the organization for which it is acting as an agent or trustee meets the criteria for inclusion as a component unit. Thus, as used in paragraph 19, the term <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fiduciary responsibility </b>encompasses all transactions and balances that would be accounted for in fiduciary funds. Statement 34, paragraph 69, provides that fiduciary funds should be used to report &quot;assets held in a trustee or agency capacity for others and therefore cannot be used to support the government&#39;s own programs.&quot; The fiduciary fund category includes pension (and other employee benefit) trust funds, investment trust funds, private-purpose trust funds, and agency funds. The three types of trust funds should be used to report resources held and administered by the reporting government when it is acting in a fiduciary capacity for individuals, private organizations, or other governments.</div></body></html>
