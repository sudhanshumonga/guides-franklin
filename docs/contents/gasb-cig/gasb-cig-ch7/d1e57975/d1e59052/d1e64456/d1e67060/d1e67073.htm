With regard to expenses, the issue is whether the amount charged or allocated to a program is a direct expense or an indirect expense. For example, if it is a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">direct</b> expense of Program A that was paid for by Program B, the amount should be included in the direct expenses of Program A. On the other hand, if it is an <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">indirect</b> expense—allocating the utility bill for the administration building, for instance—the allocation should either be reversed completely or be reversed and then reported in a separate indirect expense column in the statement of activities.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">With regard to the provider of the goods or services, the question is whether the amount received is a program revenue or a reimbursement that reduces the expenses of the &quot;charging&quot; program. In other words, is one program the &quot;customer&quot; of another program, or is the reason for the transaction simply to allocate a common expense over several programs or functions? It also might be helpful to consider whether the sale of the goods or services is a normal operating activity of the function that makes the charge. (See also Question 7.28.5.)</div></body></html>
