The government also issues debt for constructing parking facilities, with a covenant that a certain portion of the tax revenue be set aside as a reserve. How should the government distinguish between resources restricted by the enabling legislation and the bond covenant? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The bond covenant places an additional, more restrictive limitation on the use of a portion of the tax revenues but for a purpose that is nonetheless consistent with the overall limitation imposed by the enabling legislation. The portion of net position represented by the reserve should be reported as restricted for debt service (or similar category of restriction) but not disclosed as net position restricted by enabling legislation as required by paragraph 6 of Statement 46, as amended. The remainder of the resources from the tax, if any, should be reported as restricted for parking facilities (or similar category of restriction) and disclosed as net position restricted by enabling legislation.</div></body></html>
