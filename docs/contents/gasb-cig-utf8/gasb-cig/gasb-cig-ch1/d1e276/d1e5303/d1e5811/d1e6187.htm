The effects of the cap, floor, or a combination of the two (known as a collar) need to be considered in determining whether an investment is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. Investments containing a cap, a floor, or a collar may be considered highly sensitive investments because of the associated interest rate option. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_highly_sensitive_investments_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_highly_sensitive_investments_rec1">Question 1.64.1</span>.)</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Investments containing an interest rate option also may be highly sensitive notwithstanding the presence of interest rate floors and caps. For example, a government owns a variable-rate investment with a coupon that is set at 1.75 times the 3-month LIBOR with a cap of 4 percent, an investment that would be considered highly sensitive if no cap were present. When LIBOR reaches 2.28 percent, the variable-rate investment's coupon will be capped at 4 percent (2.28 percent × 1.75). If LIBOR stays between 2.28 percent and 4 percent, the fair value of the investment remains over par; however, when LIBOR rises above 4 percent, the investment acts as a fixed-rate investment with a coupon of 4 percent, and its fair value drops accordingly to increases in LIBOR. If the bond has a long maturity, it may be considered to be an investment with a fair value highly sensitive to changes in interest rates.
