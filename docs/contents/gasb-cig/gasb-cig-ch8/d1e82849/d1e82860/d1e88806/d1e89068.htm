The ARC determined as a result of the actuarial valuation should be applied beginning in the first year thereafter. For example, assume that an employer that measures triennially last applied the alternative measurement method as of June 30, 20X3, and that the ARC determined at that time applies to the employer&#39;s fiscal years ended June 30, 20X5, 20X6, and 20X7. If the employer obtains an actuarial valuation as of June 30, 20X6, which determines the ARCs for the fiscal years ended June 30, 20X8, 20X9, and 20Y0, the employer should use the more current information determined by that valuation regarding the total actuarial accrued liabilities of the plan beginning with the next financial report for which incorporation of that information is practicable. Notes to RSI should disclose the change in method if it results in a change in reported amounts that would significantly affect the interpretation of trends reported in the schedule of funding progress. However, the employer should continue to use the previously determined ARCs applicable to the years ended June 30, 20X6 and 20X7, for purposes of determining annual OPEB cost and for related note disclosures and RSI related to the ARC, annual OPEB cost, the net OPEB obligation, and employer contributions in relation to the ARC, in financial reports for those years. </div></body></html>
