Book entry system operators do not control the movement of securities among members or participants or among a member's or participant's separate accounts. The systems are simply the "vault" in which securities are held. Governments generally do not have their own accounts in the Federal Reserve or DTC book entry system; they have access to those systems through the accounts of the Federal Reserve members or DTC participants. Usually, only financial institutions and broker-dealers are members or participants. The Federal Reserve or DTC generally should not be considered to be the party that holds the securities. The systems are simply the "vault" in which securities are held. Instead, the custodian of book entry securities generally is the member or participant in whose account the investment securities are held.
