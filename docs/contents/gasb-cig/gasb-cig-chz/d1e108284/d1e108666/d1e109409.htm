Accordingly, recipients should not recognize a receivable until all of the eligibility requirements, including time requirements, are met. Footnote 12 of Statement 33 states that &quot;. . . the time requirement is met as soon as the recipient begins to honor the provider&#39;s stipulation not to sell, disburse, or consume the resources and continues to be met for as long as the recipient honors that stipulation.&quot; Therefore, the time requirement cannot be met until the resources are actually received. Hence, paragraph 73 of the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 33 states: &quot;Therefore, providers and recipients should not recognize liabilities or receivables in these kinds of transactions. Rather, they should recognize cash or other assets as expenses when paid (providers) and as revenues when received (recipients) [provided that all other eligibility requirements have been met].&quot; </div></body></html>
