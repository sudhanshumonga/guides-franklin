Statements 3 and 40 primarily address disclosure in the notes to the financial statements. The financial statement presentation requirements of Statement 9, as they relate to the presentation of cash equivalents, take precedence over discussions of deposits and investments in Statements 3 and 40. There is no requirement to reconcile the disclosures required by Statement 3, as amended, or Statement 40, as amended, to the statement of cash flows or to the statement of net position/balance sheet; however, some believe a reconciliation provides useful information.
