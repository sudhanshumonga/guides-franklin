Included in this year's total change in fund balance, however, is a loss of $1.3 million in the City's general fund. Furthermore, without the cash from the sale of park land, fund balances would be $3.5 million lower. The primary reasons for the general fund's losses mirror those highlighted in the analysis of governmental activities. In addition, these other changes in fund balances should be noted:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•The City spent $11.3 million this year on the Route 7 construction project, reducing the beginning fund balance in that capital projects fund by the same amount. This reduction was expected because fund balance at the beginning of this year included the proceeds of federal and state highway grants received late last year to finance that project. Although these and other capital expenditures reduce available fund balances, they create new assets for the City in the statement of net position (as discussed in Note 1 to the financial statements).</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•In the same way, the fund balance of the Community Redevelopment Fund increased this year when $18 million in community redevelopment housing bonds were issued. By year-end, only $2.2 million of the debt proceeds had been used for constructing housing units and $2.3 million was transferred to the debt service fund. Overall, fund balance grew $13.1 million.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Each year, the State provides the City with a portion of the gasoline tax revenues it collects. This money can only be used to replace, maintain, or improve the City's roads. This year $3 million (including $1.6 million accumulated previously) was used for 10 major repaving projects.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">General Fund Budgetary Highlights</b> </div><div class="p keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab">Over the course of the year, the City Council revised the City budget several times. These budget amendments fall into three categories:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Amendments and supplemental appropriations approved shortly after the beginning of the year to reflect the actual beginning account balances (correcting the estimated amounts in the budget adopted in October 20X1).</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Changes made in the third quarter to account for the midyear hiring and overtime freeze, some of the City's staff restructuring efforts, and the sale of an additional parcel of park land.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Increases in appropriations to prevent budget overruns.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Even with these adjustments, actual expenditures were $1.3 million below final budget amounts. The most significant positive variance ($534,646) resulted from a 10 percent reduction of the general administration workforce due to the staff restructuring and hiring freeze.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">On the other hand, resources available for appropriation were $1.1 million below the final budgeted amount. As noted earlier:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Property and other tax collections were less than expected.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Reductions in state funding also affected grant resources available for appropriation.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">These shortfalls were partially offset by a 15 percent increase in utility and cable television taxes approved by the City Council in the third quarter.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The City's general fund balance of $1.7 million differs from the general fund's <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">budgetary</b> fund balance of $1.4 million reported in the budgetary comparison schedule principally because <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">budgetary</b> fund balance excludes:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Supplies inventories of $182,821 that are reported as expenditures for budgetary purposes when they are purchased</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Encumbrances of $40,292 reported as expenditures for budgetary purposes.</div></body></html>
