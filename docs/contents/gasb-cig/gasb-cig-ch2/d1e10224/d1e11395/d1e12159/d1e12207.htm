The exceptions are specific: interfund services provided and used, interfund reimbursements, and receipts for capital purposes. Therefore, interfund loan activity should be classified as noncapital financing. However, if the loan is intended to finance capital acquisition, construction, or improvement, the borrower should classify the related cash flows in the capital and related financing activities category.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_1">For example, for the borrower, an interfund loan received to cover a temporary cash deficiency would be considered a noncapital financing activity; however, an interfund loan received for the purchase of new vehicles would be considered a capital and related financing activity. In both cases, the lender would report those cash outflows as noncapital financing activity.</div></body></html>
