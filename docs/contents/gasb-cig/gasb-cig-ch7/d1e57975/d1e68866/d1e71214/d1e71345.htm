When a PERS administers more than one defined benefit pension plan, Statement 34, as amended, requires the PERS to present combining financial statements for all plans administered and to present separate required schedules for each plan.

Statement 34 characterizes a PERS as a special-purpose government engaged only in fiduciary activities. A distinguishing characteristic of fiduciary activities, including pension and other employee benefit plans of various kinds, is that each fiduciary activity benefits a specific set of owners and beneficiaries. Thus, separate reporting of a PERS’ fiduciary activities (plans) is clearly relevant, because it is consistent with the characteristics of fiduciary activities and serves the needs of diverse sets of users. For that reason, the basic financial statements that a PERS should present are those that would be required for fiduciary funds—a statement of fiduciary net position and a statement of changes in fiduciary net position. (The basic financial statements of a PERS do not include government-wide financial statements.) Further, a PERS that administers more than one defined benefit pension plan that is administered through a trust that meets the criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs67_standards_of_governmental_accounting_and_financial_reporting">paragraph 3</span> of Statement 67 or postemployment healthcare plan that is administered through a trust that meets the criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs74_standards_of_governmental_accounting_and_financial_reporting">paragraph 3</span> of Statement 74 should meet the requirements of <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._140">paragraph 140</span> of Statement 34, as amended, by either presenting a separate column for each plan administered on the statement of fiduciary net position and the statement of changes in fiduciary net position or presenting combining statements for those plans as part of the basic financial statements.</div></body></html>
