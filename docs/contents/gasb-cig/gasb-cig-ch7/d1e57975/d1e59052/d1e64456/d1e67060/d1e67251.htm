However, the “look-back” adjustment for the internal service fund includes a significant “undercharge” involving the water utility enterprise fund. As a result, the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">internal balances</b> reported in the statement of net position are adjusted, as illustrated in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_exercise__4_reporting_internal_service_fund_balances_and_results_rec1">Exercise 4</span> of nonauthoritative Appendix B7-3. How does this year’s internal balance adjustment affect the statement of net position next year? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—That portion of a look-back adjustment that crosses activity classes is referred to as the “crossover” amount because some of the change statement expenses are allocated to one activity class (business-type), but <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">all</b> of the net position is reported in the other activity class (governmental). The <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">accumulated</b> cross-over adjustments should be carried forward from the prior year’s statement of net position. The accumulated internal balance arising from prior years’ crossover look-back adjustments is recognized in the reconciliations of government-wide net position to fund balances/net position in the funds. The adjustment is similar to the reconciling items needed to report governmental capital assets and liabilities—that is, to report balances that are included in the government-wide statements, but not in the funds. The reconciliations for both governmental and enterprise funds will need to include this item, because <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">interfund</b> balances (in the fund financial statements) are not adjusted for the look-back amounts.
