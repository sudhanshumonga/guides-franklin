The disability benefit program described provides postemployment benefits (that is, benefits provided after employment as part of an employee&#39;s total compensation for services), as indicated by the facts that eligibility for the benefits requires terminating employment and that the benefits are long term. If these long-term disability benefits are provided through a defined benefit pension plan, they should be accounted for as pensions under the requirements of Statement 68, as amended, or Statement 73, as applicable. If these disability benefits are provided separately from a defined benefit pension plan, they should be accounted for as OPEB in accordance with the requirements of Statement 45, as amended.</div></body></html>
