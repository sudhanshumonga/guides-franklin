The objective of the swap is to hedge interest rate risk. That is, the risk that changes in the benchmark interest rate, in this case the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) swap index, will adversely affect the cash flows of the variable-rate bonds. Therefore, the swap is not intended to hedge the total cash flows of the bonds. The potential hedging derivative instrument is the interest rate swap. The hedgeable items are the variable-rate bonds. Based on the consistency of the terms of the swap and the variable-rate bonds, the city determines that the swap is a hedging derivative instrument using the consistent critical terms method. Accordingly, changes in the fair values of the swap are reported as deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources in the statement of net position.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">This illustration provides the journal entries and the financial statement presentations related to this swap and the hedged bonds over the life of the swap. </div></body></html>
