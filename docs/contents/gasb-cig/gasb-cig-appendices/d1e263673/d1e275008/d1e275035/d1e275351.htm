Participation in the fund is optional. Participants are independent farmers and private-sector corporations. Fees are assessed on grains sold until the fund revenues reach a specific limit. If revenues are insufficient to pay claims, a limited amount may, with approval, be borrowed from the state. The loans are interest-bearing. In addition, the assets may be obtained for the fund from failed dealers or operators to pay claims for these failures. If fund revenues are insufficient and loan requests are denied by the state, all or parts of claims may not be paid.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> To the extent that the fund has resources to cover claims, there is transfer of risk from participants to the fund. However, the participants are nongovernmental. Therefore, the fund is not a public entity risk pool and should be reported as an insurance enterprise.</div></body></html>
