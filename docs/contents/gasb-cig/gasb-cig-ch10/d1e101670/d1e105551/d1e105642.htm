The SEC reviews the qualifications of applicant credit quality rating firms to determine whether they meet the criteria for becoming an NRSRO. Some counterparties have ratings from more than one NRSRO and sometimes those ratings differ. When multiple ratings exist and the government is aware of the different ratings, the rating indicative of the greatest degree of risk should be presented. A government, however, may also choose to disclose additional credit quality ratings, presenting the financial statement user with additional credit risk information from which to assess the credit risk assumed by the government.</div></body></html>
