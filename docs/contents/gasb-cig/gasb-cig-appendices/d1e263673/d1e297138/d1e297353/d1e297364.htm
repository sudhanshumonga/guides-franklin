Other governments with more individual functions and programs within both the business-type and governmental activity categories may not find this approach to be a viable alternative to the standard format illustrated in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_exhibit_2_statement_of_activities__rec1">Exhibit 2</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B7-1. For example, if the township government in this example had two BTAs, four more columns would be needed (two for the BTA programs, one for total BTAs, and one for the total primary government).</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">This method uses columns instead of rows to report the various functions. For a government with few functions, like this one, it may appear less complicated than the left-to-right, top-to-bottom approach of the standard statement of activities. In addition, the &quot;Total&quot; column is presented as the first column, allowing all the descriptions to follow consecutively in a single column.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The minimum requirement for level of detail to be reported in the statement of activities is to report direct expenses for each function (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#expenses_rec1">paragraph 41</span> of Statement 34). The additional details shown here (natural classifications) are not required, but are presented to demonstrate how this modified format can accommodate more information.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_97" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> (<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div></body></html>
