The total research and administrative costs of the foundation were significant to the university in the current year. The foundation occupies two buildings on campus, constructed by the foundation on land leased from the university. A significant portion of instructional faculty in the School of Engineering, Science, and Technology carry out research at the foundation, and their annual performance evaluations and merit increases at the university give formal consideration to the research they perform at the foundation.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The completion of a research grant typically results in the submittal of a report of research findings and recommendations to the grantee and, often, the publication of results in academic and professional journals. This research activity is deemed integral to the duties of faculty and is consistent with the university's mission.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">A formal agreement between the university and the foundation requires the foundation to make its general lecture and meeting rooms available, upon request, to the university, and to make certain research laboratories available for special lectures and seminars. The university's personnel office provides administrative support for the hiring of foundation personnel, including research technicians who typically are selected by committees of faculty. The relationship between the university and the foundation is disclosed in a brochure used to inform prospective faculty of the university.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Students enrolled in university graduate courses work at the foundation as research assistants. They are compensated through stipends paid by research grants, or under financial aid work-study programs administered by the university. Faculty are required to periodically report their research, instructional, and other efforts through an effort reporting system jointly administered by the foundation and the university. Faculty working on research grants typically receive a portion of their compensation from grant funds.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>The foundation is not <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">required</b> to be reported as a component unit because at least one of the criteria is not met. The "direct benefit" criterion is not satisfied because a substantial portion of the economic resources it receives and holds are for the benefit of private companies and the federal government, rather than the university. Because the first criterion is not met, neither the "entitlement/ability to access" criterion nor the "significance" criterion needs to be considered. However, given the manner in which the foundation is financially integrated with the university, a further evaluation should be made to determine whether, as a matter of professional judgment, the nature and significance of the foundation's relationship with the university (generally, its financial relationship) warrant its inclusion in the university's financial statements as a component unit.</div></body></html>
