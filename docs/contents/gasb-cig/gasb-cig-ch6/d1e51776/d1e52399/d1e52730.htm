Three floors are occupied by city agencies, and two floors are leased to a retail merchant for the sole purpose of rental income. How should the building be classified? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The classification of the office building depends on the unit of account determined by the city’s accounting policy that reflects the level of aggregation or disaggregation of the city’s real estate properties for measurement, recognition, and disclosure purposes. If the unit of account is the building, the building would not meet the definition of an investment because the present service capacity of the building is not based solely on its ability to generate cash. In that circumstance, the building would be classified as a capital asset. If the unit of account is individual floors, the floors occupied by the city should be classified as capital assets, and the leased floors that meet the definition of an investment should be classified as such.</div></body></html>
