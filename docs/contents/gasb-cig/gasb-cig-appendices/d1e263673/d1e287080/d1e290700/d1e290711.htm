The cost-sharing plan is used to provide pensions to the employees of two employersâ€”Employer A and Employer B, which receive different levels of support from the state. In the current measurement period, the state made a contribution of $24 million, of which $8 million was associated with Employer A and $16 million was associated with Employer B. In addition, during the measurement period, Employer A was required to contribute $5 million to the pension plan and Employer B was required to contribute $7 million to the pension plan. The employers determine their proportions based on contributions during the measurement period. None of the contributions were for separately financed specific liabilities to the pension plan.</div></body></html>
