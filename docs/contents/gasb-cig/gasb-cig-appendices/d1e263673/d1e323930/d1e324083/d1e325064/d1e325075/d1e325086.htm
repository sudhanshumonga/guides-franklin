The objective of the forward contract is to hedge market risk. That is, the risk that changes in the market price, in this case the price of natural gas, will adversely affect the cash flows of the expected purchase of natural gas. The potential hedging derivative instrument is the commodity forward contract that will be cash-settled. This derivative instrument would not qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception because the government is not taking physical delivery of the commodity through the commodity forward contract. The hedgeable item is the purchase of natural gas in December 20X0, an expected transaction. Based on the consistency of the terms of the forward contract and the expected purchase, the utility determines that the forward contract is a hedging derivative instrument using the consistent critical terms method. Accordingly, the increase in fair value of the forward contract is reported as a deferred inflow of resources in the statement of net position as of June 30, 20X0.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">This illustration provides the journal entries and the financial statement presentations related to this commodity forward contract and the expected purchase of natural gas over the life of the forward contract. </div></body></html>
