The school districts face only the same custodial credit risk that the treasurer faces. The county treasurer, functioning in his or her official capacity as investment manager for the districts, is not considered an outside party that poses custodial risk as a financial institution or broker-dealer performing the same function would; therefore, the treasurer should not be considered a counterparty for financial reporting purposes.</div></body></html>
