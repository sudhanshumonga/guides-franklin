Brewer State University contributes to the State University Retiree Health Plan (SURHP), a cost-sharing multiple-employer defined benefit postemployment healthcare plan administered by the Grande Retirement System. SURHP provides medical benefits to retired employees of participating universities. Article 38 of the Statutes of the State of Grande assigns the authority to establish and amend benefit provisions to the SURHP board of trustees. The Grande Retirement System issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for SURHP. That report may be obtained by writing to Grande Retirement System, State Government Lane, Latte, GR 01000, or by calling 1-800-555-PLAN.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Funding Policy.</b> Article 38 provides that contribution requirements of the plan members and the participating employers are established and may be amended by the SURHP board of trustees. Plan members or beneficiaries receiving benefits contribute $65 per month for retiree-only coverage and $135 for retiree and spouse coverage to age 65, and $35 and $75 per month, respectively, thereafter.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Participating universities are contractually required to contribute at a rate assessed each year by SURHP, currently 8.75 percent of annual covered payroll. The SURHP board of trustees sets the employer contribution rate based on the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">annual required contribution of the employers (ARC),</b> an amount actuarially determined in accordance with the parameters of Statement 45, as amended. The ARC represents a level of funding that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities (or funding excess) of the plan over a period not to exceed thirty years. The university&#39;s contributions to SURHP for the years ended June 30, 20X2, 20X1, and 20X0, were $58,717, $49,886, and $47,375, respectively, which equaled the required contributions each year.</div></body></html>
