The city meets all of the eligibility requirements (for example, the period when the resources are required to be used has begun, reimbursable costs have been incurred), but the state has not yet appropriated resources for the grant. Can the city recognize grant revenue? Would the timing of the recognition change if state law requires the state treasurer to pay the grant whether or not the legislature appropriates resources?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>In the absence of legislation requiring the state treasurer to pay the grant whether or not the legislature appropriates the resources, the state should appropriate resources before the city can recognize the grant revenue. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs33_par._74">Paragraph 74</span> in the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 33 states that, &quot;when the provider is a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">government,</b> the required period of disbursement often is specified through the appropriation of resources under the enabling legislation, rather than as part of that legislation or related regulations. . . . In those cases, a government appropriation is <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">not</b> equivalent to an authorization to pay an <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">existing</b> liability, such as the approval of a vendor&#39;s invoice for payment related to an exchange transaction that has occurred. Rather, an appropriation is <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">essential</b> to make the enabling legislation effective for a particular period of time. In these circumstances, . . . a government does not have a liability to transmit resources under a particular program, and a recipient does not have a receivable, unless an appropriation for that program exists and the period to which the appropriation applies has begun. Once those requirements (and all other applicable eligibility requirements) have been met, a provider government should recognize a liability and a qualified recipient should recognize a receivable.&quot; </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Conversely, if state law requires the state treasurer to pay the grant whether or not the legislature appropriates resources, the city should recognize grant revenue in the current period without regard to when the legislature appropriates resources. In this case, the required period of disbursement is not specified through the appropriation of resources. Rather, it is specified by the enabling legislation or its related regulations. An appropriation is not essential to make the enabling legislation effective for a particular period of time and, if made, is equivalent to an authoritization to pay an existing liability as discussed in paragraph 74 of the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 33.</div></body></html>
