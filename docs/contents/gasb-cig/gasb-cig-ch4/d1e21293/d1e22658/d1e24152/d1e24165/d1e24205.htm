Because of the differences in the relationships that a primary government has with blended component units versus discretely presented component units, it is more likely that it would be misleading to exclude an organization that would be <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">blended</b> than it would be to exclude one that would be <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">discretely presented.</b> </div></body></html>
