In this situation, although different contribution rates are established for different employers, all plan assets legally are available to pay benefits pertaining to the employees of any employer. Therefore, this plan is classified as a cost-sharing multiple-employer plan for purposes of applying Statement 67, as amended.</div></body></html>
