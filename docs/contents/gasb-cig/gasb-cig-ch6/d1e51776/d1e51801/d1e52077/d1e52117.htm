The contract requires that the “retainage” be accounted for in a separate fund or evidenced by a specific investment. This retainage is invested for the benefit of the contractor and is released upon completion of the contract. How should the retainage be reported?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—If the county determines that a separate fund should be used for financial reporting purposes, the retainage should be reported in a private-purpose trust fund or, if held for a short period, an agency fund. Because the county has invested the retainage, the county should value and report that investment in accordance with Statement 31, as amended, and Statement 72.</div></body></html>
