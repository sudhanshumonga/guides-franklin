The bonds are a liability of the issuing government, but the buildings will be reported as capital assets of the respective legally separate school districts. Which component of the government&#39;s net position should be reduced by the long-term debt?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The issuing government acquires no capital assets; therefore, the debt is not &quot;capital-related.&quot; The effect of the noncapital debt should be reflected in the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">unrestricted</b> component of the government&#39;s net position. The fact that the bonds are related to capital assets of another entity does not make the debt &quot;capital&quot; debt of the issuing government—even though the assets acquired may benefit its residents. The government has incurred a liability, decreasing its net position, with no corresponding increase in its capital or financial assets. The effect on the government&#39;s total net position should be the same regardless of whether it (a) gave the school districts cash from existing resources, (b) constructed the buildings and donated them to the schools, or (c) issued debt to finance the construction. In all three instances, the government has decreased its net position.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the effect on unrestricted net position is significant, the government may disclose additional details of unrestricted net position in the notes to the financial statements to isolate the effect of debt issued for others. The government may also address these circumstances in MD&amp;A as part of either the net position or debt discussions.</div></body></html>
