Bank Z is the government's regular custodial agent and holds the investment securities in the government's name. However, Bank Z uses Bank A as its correspondent for settlement of all transactions and safekeeping of all securities. Bank A is holding the securities for Bank Z on behalf of Bank Z's customers. Are these investment securities subject to custodial credit risk disclosures?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No<b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">. </b>The investment securities are not exposed to custodial credit risk because Bank Z <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">is</b> performing the custody function for the government despite its use of Bank A as a correspondent. The facts of the question show that Banks A and Z are unaffiliated and the government's use of Bank Z for custody and Bank Z's use of Bank A as a settlement and safekeeping agent are ordinary and regular business arrangements.</div></body></html>
