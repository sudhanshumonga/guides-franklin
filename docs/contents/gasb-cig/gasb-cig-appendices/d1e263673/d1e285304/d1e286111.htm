Once created, any eligible local government may join the council by ratifying the council charter and receiving a majority vote for admission by the existing 20 members. The council&#39;s governing board is made up of an equal number of delegates from each participating government. Member governments may withdraw from the council at the end of any fiscal year by giving at least 60 days&#39; notice. Withdrawal will not dissolve the council as long as two members remain. The council&#39;s major revenue sources are federal and state grants, which it administers on behalf of the member governments, and member dues, which are determined by the board. The member governments do not retain an equity interest in either the assets or the liabilities of the council; however, the member governments would receive a share of the net position if the council was dissolved. The day-to-day functions of the organization are controlled by the board. The council is entitled to any surpluses and is required to finance its own deficits. The council may not issue debt.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The regional council of governments would not be a component unit of any of the participating governments because no single government appoints a voting majority of a council of a government&#39;s board. The regional council would not be a joint venture because it is unlikely that the membership dues would constitute an ongoing financial responsibility as defined in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#ongoing_financial_responsibility_rec1">paragraph 71</span> of Statement 14, which states that a participating government has an ongoing financial responsibility if the organization&#39;s continued existence depends on continued funding by the government. Therefore, the regional council of governments should be reported as a jointly governed organization by the participating governments in accordance with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#jointly_governed_organizations_rec1">paragraph 77</span> of Statement 14.</div></body></html>
