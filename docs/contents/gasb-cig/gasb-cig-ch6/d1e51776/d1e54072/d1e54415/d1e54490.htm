Dividends and interest income received on the investments in that fund are transferred per state statute, to a special needs program accounted for in a special revenue fund in which it will supplement state grants also restricted to that purpose. However, because the transferred income is calculated on a basis other than fair value, there are differences between the amount the trust fund recognizes as investment income and the amount actually transferred to the special needs program. How does the trust report the difference? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Because this trust agreement does not provide for the spending of net appreciation, any unrealized gains should be included in the same fund balance classification as the investments—in this case, nonspendable. If the trust agreement does provide for spending some or all of the net appreciation, and the amount transferred to the special revenue fund is less than the total permitted, the undistributed amount should be classified as restricted.</div></body></html>
