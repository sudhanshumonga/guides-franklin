Statement 38 indicates that “principal and interest requirements to maturity should be disclosed for each of the five subsequent fiscal years and in five-year increments thereafter. Interest requirements for variable-rate debt should be determined using the rate in effect at the financial statement date” (paragraph 10a of Statement 38). When there is a hedging derivative instrument, Statement 53 indicates that the net cash flows of that derivative instrument also should be disclosed (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.74">paragraph 74</span>). The fair value of a receive-variable leg of an interest rate swap represents the present value of future payments based on expected future rates. Should the net cash flows of the hedging derivative instrument be based on the rate in effect at the financial statement date, consistent with the requirements of Statement 38 for variable-rate debt, or the expected future rates?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—In order to be consistent with the variable-rate debt disclosure required by Statement 38, the variable rate in effect for the hedging swap’s variable-rate payment at the financial statement date should be used. A separate column may be presented to depict the effect of the hedging swap’s variable rate payments on the variable rate debt payments assuming current interest rates on the variable rate bonds and the current reference rates on the hedging derivative will remain the same.
