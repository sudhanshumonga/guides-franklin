In NRZ one bit is transmitted per symbol (or unit interval UI) versus two per UI (or symbol) in PAM4. This means the data rate is doubled while the channel bandwidth is kept constant. This is possible by using 4 amplitude levels instead of 2 (see figure 1). The absolute amplitude between lowest and top level stays the same though introducing new signal integrity issues as we will see."

            "content": "In today's digital environment, data security is a top priority for businesses of all sizes. As cyber security pitfalls continue to evolve and become more sophisticated, it is essential to administer robust security measures to protect sensitive data and resources. Two key security concepts gaining traction in the industry are Mutual Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Zero Trust. Mutual TLS is a protocol that enables secure communication between server and client by enforcing TLS authentication for every request. Zero Trust, on the other hand, is a security model that assumes that no device or user is inherently trusted and that access to sensitive resources is granted only, when necessary, based on the principle of least privilege. The combination of Mutual TLS with Zero Trust provides a powerful security solution that ensures secure communications and restricts access to sensitive data and resources, for devices and users at the edge of the network."

Switching these instruments for a single board (DUT) can easily generate over ten connections or more. Similarly, if we increase the number of DUT, the number of connections multiplies. Panelized board design is gaining adoption as it maximizes the throughput in production. With the increase in number of boards (DUT) in each panel, the requirement to switch the instruments around becomes significant."

Episode 9 guest Toby Marsden was able to put names to many aspects of what I loved so much about data. When I am trying to make sense of a new topic or, as in this case, am trying to process additional details about a topic I am familiar with, my mind always tries to find a more relatable comparison from a subject area I am intimately familiar with.

There are usually three to ten different software tools used by an organization for each process. Product introduction times, product performance issues, and poor quality can contribute, at least in part, to this complexity, both during production and possibly during customer support."

Through history, engineering breakthroughs have shaped the human experience. The wheel and calendar, printing press and cotton gin, electricity and the assembly lines are the vehicles by which we tell the story of human progress. Henry Ford's assembly line not only democratized motor vehicle ownership, but, by enabling mass production, transformed industries far beyond discrete manufacturing. As we move into a new age defined by the full integration of the physical and digital worlds, the once hardware-centric auto sector must evolve to adapt to a new era defined by software. Digital twin enabled design and test workflows are streamlining this paradigm shift in the automotive industry from mechanical and analogue components to digital electronics and the intelligent machines enabling the Internet of Things (IoT)."

As we started to work together, a cyber range unit began to form naturally, a kind of “commando” within the department."

In December, the 3GPP standards body aligned on the priorities and scope of Release 18 of 5G—the first to be designated “advanced,” and which will support more device types and use cases. In addition, the trend to virtualize networks is causing major changes in how wired and wireless networking are orchestrated, as well as disrupting business models. Finally, as we near the end of the third year of 5G deployment, aligning on the next generation (6G) has never been so visible and critical. Are these trends really that significant? We think so and here is why."

As frequency increases, the propagation losses increase as well. Signal quality is more susceptible to modulation errors, phase noise, distortion, and other impairments. To maintain the same system performance, devices must meet more stringent linearity requirements."

So even if the test plans are meant for different projects, the set of variables used in them can be similar. In addition, if the configuration of instruments used in a system remains the same, then probably the test method remains similar and so do the variables.

The samples can help you test if your security solutions can catch the known popular malware families with previously never seen hashes. ATI have been delivering polymorphic samples as part of the monthly malware since 2020 which were mostly for the Windows platform and has recently extended it to include Android polymorphic malwares. The Android samples were delivered in the November 2022 Monthly Malware update by ATI as part of the standard ATI subscription."

Enterprises and customers are dependent on Wi-Fi, and it now has to cater to densely populated conditions. Each generation of the Wi-Fi standard evolves fast including features that support new requirements.\n\nWi-Fi 6, also known as 802.11ax, promises 4x performance gain in dense environments and ensures latency improvement using OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiple Access) and multi-user MIMO technologies. It enables access points (APs) to support more clients in dense environments."

Aided by technologies such as Bluetooth Low Energy, WiFi, and 5G, the pace of Internet of Things (IoT) deployment continues to accelerate. In fact, in a recent Forrester report, 69% of surveyed respondents estimate that at least half of all devices on their enterprise network or IoT are unmanaged, and 26% estimate that unmanaged devices outnumber managed devices on their network by three to one.

Its evolution has kept pace with technological innovations such as cellular networks, wireless protocols, and complex modulation techniques. As analyzers adopted new functionalities and capabilities, the traditional terminology and classification of these devices became more diverse, sometimes leading to confusion. On top of this, analysis in the frequency domain has grown beyond traditional spectrum analysis to include additional types of instruments such as RF recorders, vector network analyzers, and – as I’ll highlight in this blog – oscilloscopes. Let’s look at how the spectrum analyzer has evolved into the signal analyzer and how it relates to the modern oscilloscope."

Hence, HTTPS became the de-facto standard for HTTP communications. The most recent version of the HTTP protocol, HTTP/3, is built on top of HTTP/2. By enhancing user experience, reducing the effects of packet loss without head-of-line blocking, accelerating (HTTPS) handshake process, and enabling encryption by default, HTTP/3 is intended to alleviate some of the performance difficulties inherent with HTTP/2."

Wideband performance benefits come with a heavy cost: significantly increased noise. This noise introduces additional test complexity and measurement uncertainty which is further exacerbated by industry’s desire to pack as many modulated signals into the available bandwidth as possible. This not only constrains error vector magnitude (EVM) requirements further, but also degrades system signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). So how can you simplify the performance verification process while ensuring component's standard compliance?"

When two wire bonds come very close to each other, but are not electrically shorted, that results in a near short condition. This presents a potential reliability issue. The insulative barrier between the wires can give way over time, or after extended stress, resulting in a catastrophic failure of the device. Depending on the IC application, such a failure can result in loss of life."

A cell’s power density, dissipation, efficiency, and state of health (SoH) all depend on its internal resistance. However, a cell’s internal resistance is anything but a single, unvarying value. It has a complex frequency-dependent nature that relates to specific electronic and ionic attributes within the cell. Further, it is dependent on the cell’s temperature, state of charge (SoC), size, chemical makeup, construction, and age. The state of the cell and test conditions need to be explicitly set to have results that are relevant and comparable.\nThe most common methodologies for measuring a cell’s internal resistance include electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), alternating current internal resistance (AC-IR), and direct current internal resistance (DC-IR). Each of these are uniquely different making them particularly useful in certain applications while not being well suited for others. Let’s find out why!"

To what depth a system can measure can be thought of as its potential. Determining what aspects of those measurements must be sent to the processor can be thought of as delivering that potential. Finally, knowing how to combine the salient parts of those measurements in the correct proportions, known as sensor fusion, is the key to exploring an algorithm’s IQ or reasoning potential. Augment that sensor fusion with a feedback loop and the algorithm will have the ability to check and course-correct its logic, a necessary ingredient in machine learning."

Further complexity is added with 5G FR2’s millimeter wave (mmWave) carrier frequencies, wide bandwidth signals, and complex modulation schemes which impose stringent component error vector magnitude (EVM) qualification. Designers face increasing challenges in generating accurate device models, minimizing design cycles, and certifying their device’s 5G conformance with a traditional EVM measurement signal analyzer set-up."

Two distinct categories you’ve probably heard about are real-time scopes and sampling scopes, each of which have advantages for specific applications. Understanding the differences between these two instruments can help determine which one is right for your use case."

And while recognition from such prestigious organizations with solid research methodologies helps substantiate sentiment across employee groups, each person has their own prioritization of what makes a great company. Having worked for Keysight since its formation in 2014, I always viewed the company as the right fit for me. But our leadership’s response to the challenges of the last few years is what, in my opinion, solidifies Keysight as a best place to work, and exemplifies what separates good companies from great companies."

The ability to now get the right data at the right time becomes even more crucial. One can find that there are many articles discussing data storage systems (Data Lakes, HDFS, HBase) and data retrieval and query solutions (SQL, Impala, Hive). However, you may not often encounter topics about how to collect device and test equipment data. The solution will require covering two closely related areas, data parsing, and the data pipeline.

Despite having readily available platforms (like various public clouds) that are offering tons of managed services and ready-to-use product images and even despite having vendors offering deployment templates, it still seems like the barrier of entry to properly test and evaluate a new product is relatively high.

While this is often easier said than done, one possible area of focus to save some budget is in the area of security and monitoring tools. For instance, what if you were able to extend the life of your existing tools a little longer by improving their efficiency? I’ll show you an example of how you can do just that."

HTTP evasions are evasions that affect how the traffic is seen in the wire for HTTP protocols. Think of it like changing all the 'GET' requests to 'POST' requests. These evasions should allow us to better craft the traffic to match what an attacker might be doing to evade security defenses."

In my article I walked through 10 main steps of the manufacturing process, starting with preparing the materials that go into the cell’s construction and ending with final testing and grading. While these 10-steps are comprehensive, manufacturers are always looking at ways to enhance their process to better suit their specific needs. One way to consider enhancing the cell manufacturing process is adding a pre-charge step, as illustrated in Figure 1. As shown, pre-charge is a step that takes place before formation."

Multicast forwarding is complex and resource-intensive. In a multicast network, each specific flow requires the construction of a dedicated path tree and each node forwards the packet following the tree. This requires transit nodes to maintain state on a per-flow basis and to participate in multicast-specific tree building. Different multicast tree-building protocols used today include mLDP-P2MP and RSVP-TE P2MP. These protocols have their own complexity, resource requirement, and multicast tree maintenance in the network, making multicast very expensive in terms of resources."

This training was achieved with signals intelligence specialists with Team Ronin of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing intelligence section. Such specialized training underscores the need for government and military personnel to understand how their systems function in the electromagnetic spectrum operations (EMSO) environment – especially in response to threats.\n\nIn today’s EMSO environment, unknown threats constantly emerge. If successful, an attack prevents an opponent from leveraging the EM spectrum to achieve their operational objectives. With accurate threat detection and analysis, your EW systems can successfully react to threats with prevailing countermeasures.\n\nUnfortunately, the threat of your system not responding adequately always looms. Such uncertainty leads to an unacceptable level of risk in mission-critical operations. For insight into how an EW system will respond with electronic countermeasures (ECMs), you can generate threats for your system and evaluate the resulting ECM response."

            "content": "Intensified sensitivity for cellular communication, increased speed for high-throughput satellite communication, enhanced range resolution for automotive radar applications―the amazing and lucrative opportunities of millimeter wave (mmWave) technology implementation are advertised everywhere. Deployment complexities, however, are often overlooked. Whether you prefer the iconic original Star Trek or eagerly await the Star Trek: Picard reboot’s second season, there is no denying that the classic sci-fi introductory theme imploring audiences, “...to seek out new life and new civilizations. To boldly go where no one has gone before,” unintentionally encapsulates millimeter wave technology's innovative imperative. If we hope to capture the same level of success in our quest as our celestial heroes had in theirs, we must overcome critical challenges including path loss, wideband noise, and frequency response. In a webinar examining how to tackle mmWave challenges, Paris Akhshi, Analytics and Instrumentation PhD and Product Marketing Manager at Keysight, discusses how flexible N9042B signal analyzer hardware and software enable optimized solutions for these mmWave metrology hurdles.\n\nPreviously, conducted measurements, predicated on wired device-under-test (DUT) probe points, were feasible test methods given lower frequency technology. However, over-the-air (OTA) tests are required for 5G New Radio (5G NR) mmWave spectrum technologies because components designed for mmWave devices are compact with no place to probe. Unfortunately, measuring performance via OTA methods increases difficulty achieving accurate, reproducible results. These complexities are exacerbated by high frequency path loss and wideband noise, as well as high frequency and wideband’s impact on frequency response.\n\nAt these higher frequencies, increased path loss between instruments and DUTs often results in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). In turn, this induces difficulty in acquiring signal analysis measurements including error vector magnitude (EVM). Additionally, wideband also negatively impacts SNR. While wideband enables advantages such as higher throughput, faster data rate, and lower latency, it comes with a cost: more noise is introduced to the system. Transmitted signals must now compete with a channel’s higher noise floor in order to be accurately detected. Finally, high operation frequency and wideband also make DUT isolation and characterization more arduous. Test system components such as cables, connectors, and fixtures between the signal analyzer and DUT contribute to erroneous frequency responses in amplitude and phase, degrading modulation quality.\n\nDr. Akhshi addresses mmWave complexities by discussing several RF signal paths — such as default path, microwave preselector bypass, low-noise path, and full-bypass path — to reduce noise, improve sensitivity, and achieve higher SNR. Additionally, Dr. Akhshi elaborates on how to improve signal condition with an optimized mixer in the system setup.\n\nBoldly going into the new frontier of mmWave technology promises revolutionary advancements in everyday life and fundamental alterations to society’s infrastructure. With these massive changes come new challenges, most immediately including excessive path loss, wideband noise, and convoluted frequency response.

More broadly, this is a phenomenon known in physics as the Observer Effect. Every seasoned engineer knows not to use a regular DMM to measure the quiescent current of a low power device. The burden voltage affects the circuit sufficiently such that the measurements are no longer accurate. All electronic instruments are affected by this in varying degrees but in the world of mmWave (5GNR, Ka, V-band, etc.) this effect is greatly magnified by a multitude of factors. Why does mmWave pose such challenges? What can be done to mitigate the problems? Let’s explore these ideas and more."

            "content": "Government and military investment in fifth-generation (5G) cellular continues to climb worldwide. Contracts already leverage 5G to improve inventory management and related tasks via an “Internet of Military Things” approach. Yet 5G is also set to advance or enable additional use cases in aerospace defense. From critical communications through non-terrestrial networks (NTN), autonomous driving, and even robotic surgery, 5G plans to vastly boost capabilities and performance for military and government users.\n\nCurrent critical communications networks serve military, government, and public safety personnel with ad hoc communications to boost networks in emergencies and fill coverage holes. 5G cellular greatly extends those capabilities, allowing 5G network deployment on bases, in emergency scenarios, and on the battlefield. It also enables a broad variety of applications across military and government, as planes, ships, Humvees, and other vehicles will integrate 5G connectivity.\n\nCritical communications use cases for 5G range from enhanced mobile broadband to ultra-reliable low-latency and massive machine-type communications, as well as increased security. Tactical networks could provide augmented / virtual reality in combat and combat training, battlefield telesurgery, tactical self-driving vehicles, ad hoc secure communications, and connected battlefield assets such as planes, ships, and missiles.\n\nThose self-driving military vehicles will spawn their own opportunities and use cases. Outfitted with 5G for long-haul communications, aircraft, ships, Humvees, and other vehicles can use 5G to enable communications, high-data-rate video conferencing, and Internet of Things sensors. Eventually, these capabilities will evolve into self-driving or autonomous vehicles. The goal is to eliminate service members from some missions, although a hybrid approach will require someone on board to oversee vehicle performance."

Around the world, water scarcity already affects one in three people, and less than 1% of the earth’s water is safe for consumption. In addition, according to the EPA, continued climate change is likely to lead to an increase in water demand while at the same time shrinking water supplies, particularly in areas where populations are growing. Even in areas that are not at such a high risk for water shortages, an increase in flooding or a rise in sea level is expected, which in turn impacts the quality of available water and severely damages infrastructure used for the delivery of consumable water."

Top vendors have designed new tools specifically for monitoring networks with virtualization, cloud infrastructure, distributed data centers, and edge computing. Way back in 2016, Enterprise Management Associates found that 24% of enterprises used 6-10 monitoring tools and another 34% used 11 or more. I did not find more recent research, but I think it’s safe to assume the number is growing."

Grooming removes unnecessary information and prepares packets for faster processing by security and monitoring tools. I liken to compare packet grooming to the prep work done by the sous-chef in a busy kitchen. Everything is geared to making the head chef super-efficient and to serving the meals as quickly as possible."

Pieces of information regarding this possibly \"wormable\" security issue in the Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) protocol have accidentally leaked online before Microsoft released the regular patches for Windows clients to download. Similar to EternalBlue, the exploitation of this vulnerability does not require authentication and leads to remote code execution on the targeted machine after a successful attempt."

Maintenance and upgrade of these switches are inevitable. In a recent study by Microsoft, researchers studied the switch reboots as one of the main points of failure. Reboot is often used as a recovery from failures, including hardware and software issues (see Microsoft paper). Now, many Switch and ASIC vendors are supporting the features where we can upgrade or reboot a particular service or a system as a whole with very minimal interruption or no impact on services."

But in this case, I thought it would be beneficial to look at Cloud intrusion detection systems (IDS) from the perspective of a Google Cloud customer. As with most cloud services, there are little to no barriers in trying Cloud IDS, and so it made sense to publish a cookbook on setting up a validation sandbox any customer could follow and decide if Cloud IDS is a good fit for their environment."

A properly implemented DFS functionality is required to ensure a wireless device detects radar signals and switches its operating frequency to avoid causing interference to radar systems. Read this blog to find out how you can simplify DFS testing.",

Cybercriminals are also constantly evolving and finding new ways to exploit network vulnerabilities. Seeing all network traffic is a must for ensuring high security and performance. Partial visibility is simply not good enough. If data packets are missing, corrupted or dropped entirely before they even reach your security and monitoring tools, blind spots develop, making it impossible to see the full picture of everything happening on your network. Network blind spots open the door to performance issues and security risks. Recently I had the opportunity to sit down with Mark Pierpoint, Keysight’s president of network applications and security, to discuss how implementing a network visibility architecture can uncover and prevent dangerous blind spots that too often wreak havoc on even well-established enterprises."

Electrical engineering, after all, is at the heart of just about every technology revolution, including autonomous vehicles, quantum computing, and energy, and labs are critical to exposing students to the tools needed to enable future innovations. The question became more provocative as he added that the current equipment in the university teaching lab was all functional, being composed of decades-old HP and Agilent (now Keysight) electronic test instruments. Indeed, to teach electrical engineering concepts, that twenty-plus year-old equipment works fine. From an historical perspective, Lord Maxwell’s articulation of the theory of electromagnetism, the basis for electrical engineering, has been around for a century and a half. So why can’t the electrical test equipment used to teach it be of older vintage? I put Lord Maxwell aside and dug deeper into the question from the perspective of the university, the students, and the parents. Here are my thoughts."

When a radar appears to an EW system, the EW system should evaluate it and potentially reprogram itself in a fast manner to defeat that radar threat. From the radar system point of view, the goal may be to verify that it can mitigate newer cognitive jamming or EW capabilities. As a result, their goal is to verify that EW systems cannot successfully launch an electronic attack against them. For both types of systems, simulating and recording these scenarios in the real-world signal environment offers a clear view into the systems’ responses and, ultimately, the outcome. Understanding how your system was defeated will help you make changes to your system so that it prevails in the EM spectrum environment in the future."

The ransomware would be better referred to as extortionware, since it steals the data before encryption, thereby allowing the threat actor to leverage the threat of releasing the data should the ransom fail to be paid. In this case, every minute the pipeline was disabled led to heavy financial loss, and may well have been leverage enough to pay the ransom. Attribution of the attack was confirmed by the FBI to be Darkside with links to Russia, and it has some very interesting differentiators."

One of my old friends called and sounded frustrated. Roger works in the testing team of a well-known silicon vendor who is working on system on chip (SoC) implementing TSN – specifically time-aware shaper (IEEE 802.1Qbv). Roger was working on an early development build for validating the Qbv gate open and close accuracy of the SoC. “These developers think they can provide any half-cooked implementation as a QA drop,” he said. “They don’t understand how difficult it is to validate with all those hacks being present !!”"

And CLIs (Command Line Interfaces) are what you think of for networking and device configurations. However, as modern networks become increasingly disaggregated and distributed and require connectivity and policy enforcement across heterogeneous domains, the management and deployment of these networks are also being overhauled. This is where APIs become key to managing large-scale, distributed systems, cloud-native, and service-based architectures for networking."

By improving communications performance and capacity, it can boost communications for military personnel. It also can enhance intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. Beyond such examples of boosted communications performance, however, it also offers the potential for new applications and use cases. In an expert virtual roundtable, we brought together a panel of experts to discuss the potential of 5G – specifically, for the U.S. government and military. Among the topics that emerged most critical was the issue of 5G and security."

Testing will simply prove that “flipping a coin” to determine vendor choice is just as risk-free as a full qualification. The results however showed that this could not be further from the truth. We will publish the methodology and results shortly and it should be interesting!"

Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), is a well-known technology that brings major benefits when it comes to high-performance computing or storage applications, by enabling memory data transfers between applications over a network without involving the host’s CPU (by having the application communicate directly to an RDMA-enabled network card, bypassing the host's TCP/IP stack). It enables efficient data movement at high throughput, low latency, and low CPU overhead, which also results in reduced power, cooling, and rack space requirements. Initially, RDMA was defined to work over InfiniBand network stacks and this hindered its adoption."

Border Gateway Protocol or BGP is the key protocol that keeps the network running behind the scenes. Over years, BGP has developed different applications but each application needs to be benchmarked with respect to the KPIs of the industry it is serving. The cloud titans, hyperscalers have very strict requirements when it comes to failover times to maintain the SLAs that they commit to. The requirement is then pushed down to the network operators, eventually to the whole supply chain down to the NEMs and ASIC manufacturers to ensure that at each level, we are doing checks that the end goal is met."

I was a bit surprised since SR adoption became popular around 2017 and almost all the large equipment vendors were implementing it in their devices. The validation cycle continued throughout 2018 and 2019 and all the top vendors were using Ixia’s IxNetwork for functional and scale testing of SR protocol implementations . Then why is there a renewed demand for conformance testing at this later stage? Digging a bit deeper revealed that one of the challenges the network equipment manufacturers (NEMs) are facing is ensuring interoperability with other implementations that service providers may be using."

It provides ample margin for performance improvement, but it also creates many challenges. At millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, excessive path loss makes RF power limited and costly. Any skew in a flange connection can cause unwanted reflections that degrade signal quality and power. Also, the components designed for mmWave devices are compact and highly integrated with no place to probe, resulting in the need for radiated tests, also known as over-the-air (OTA) tests. For typical radio applications, the free space path loss (FSPL) formula in terms of dB is expressed as:"

            "content": "Not all printed circuit board assemblies (PCBAs) are square or rectangle in shape and that makes automated handling of the PCBA in the manufacturing line a challenge. To transport a PCBA along a conveyor line, it requires straight edges on both sides of the circuit board for the conveyor belt to support. This is why contract electronic manufacturers build odd shaped PCBAs into a quadrilateral panel to maintain straight edges for transporting along the conveyor belts. It is more cost effective to produce small PCBAs in larger panels and then cut each of them out later. This saves material costs, reduces material wastage, and allow easier handling in the assembly process."

According to the National Center for Education Statistics1, there are approximately 300,000 HBCU students, with African American students comprising 76% of enrollment. Historically, however, HBCUs have been on the sidelines of investment and advancement, which has been particularly detrimental to science and engineering. Additional challenges include recruitment and retention of students within engineering programs. From a nationwide university perspective, 4-year graduation rates are below 30% for students in engineering, rising to 40% for graduation within six years, according to a 2017 study by the American Society for Engineering Education2 (ASEE)."

To provide a global service to pool resources, balance workloads, and provide business data closer to the edge, cloud service providers typically interconnect two or more individual data centers.

As each new standard is introduced, data rates increase and so do the design challenges. These higher speeds drive additional need for equalization techniques in transmitters and receivers to compensate for channel loss. Add to this the signal degradation caused by printed circuit boards or cables between the transmitter and receiver, and compensation can be a real challenge.

As the automotive industry gears up for autonomous driving, I wonder how these self-driving cars will fare versus the human driver. Autonomous vehicles (AVs) will depend on a host of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication technology to steer their way safely forward."

            "author": "Giovanni D'Amore",
            "description": "The millimeter-wave is the part of the electromagnetic spectrum with frequency from 30 to 300 GHz. Until recently, the frequencies used for communication purpose were limited to the microwave band, typically defined to cover the 3-30 GHz range. The majority of the commercial wireless networks use the lower part of this band - between 800 MHz and 6 GHz, alias the sub-6 GHz band. That means that the 3G/4G/5G cellular connection on your smartphone, your home WiFi, the Bluetooth connection on your wireless headset and almost anything you can think of, will use those frequencies to transmit information. This represents the main critical challenge of today’s wireless network. While the number of users and devices consuming data increase exponentially, the radio spectrum frequency band available by the telecom carriers is unchanged. This means that each user is allocated a limited amount of bandwidth, leading to slower speeds and frequent disconnections.",

The goal of network visibility was (and still is) to gather copies of network data such as packets, as well as network derived metadata such as flows, and deliver them to security and performance monitoring tools where the data can be stored, searched, analyzed, and reported for use cases including threat hunting, incident response, application performance monitoring and more. The first building block of network visibility was use of the switch mirror port, or network tap device, to gather copies of packets from a single network link. But for large environments with many network links, of increasing speeds, and many different tools needing access to the data, the simple mirror or tap wasn’t enough and didn’t scale. So the next building block become the network packet broker appliance which could gather data from many links of varying speeds, optimize the data feed using techniques such as de-duplication, decryption, filtering, and load balancing, replication of the traffic to different tools, and otherwise add a flexible enterprise grade layer for network visibility."

The latter involves improving your organization’s overall security posture and defending against a broad range of threats, but that’s only half the battle. Managing cyber risk means mitigating liabilities — like a DDoS attack bringing down a manufacturing plant, or a data breach exposing the company to legal action and compliance fees — and that's a bit tougher. Is a new tool the answer, or is another dashboard just going to complicate things further? Can cyber insurance help? How can you free up valuable cycles for your staff to investigate incidents?"

A key transmission component is a Front-End Module (FEM), and a PA is a subcomponent of a FEM. The PA is in the last stage of the transmission chain and generates the RF power transmitted to the antenna. PA designers seek to maximize bandwidth linearity while maintaining a high level of modulation efficiency. This balance is challenging to achieve across extremely wide signal bandwidths in the millimeter-wave (mm Wave) frequency spectrum. To measure the nonlinearity of a PA under a modulated stimulus condition, the industry traditionally uses Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) as a figure of merit (FOM) for in-band characteristics and adjacent channel power ratio (ACPR) for out-of-band characteristics."

But there isn’t a single ZTA solution. The architecture is composed of numerous components, that when taken together, form a paradigm for dealing with security that is appropriate in a modern world where corporate enterprises are no longer confined to a well-defined and trustworthy perimeter (think remote work, cloud etc). For reference, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has created a very detailed ZTA publication https://www.nist.gov/publications/zero-trust-architecture . In this blog, I’ll attempt to distill down relevant concepts and elaborate a bit on the particular components related to security visibility."

As the number of presentations were considerably reduced, I count myself as being one of the lucky ones who they decided to retain for the virtual event. The title of my presentation was “Achieving valid self-discharge measurements: How external factors impact results.” This was a nice sequel to what I presented at the Novi Conference in 2019 and wrote a blog post on; “Shortening Lithium Ion Cell Manufacturing Time: A Comparative Study of Two Methods of Making Self-Discharge Measurements.” (Click on the title to learn more!)"

Our designs are increasingly digital, but analog signals with infinite resolution will always exist. Since most of us don’t work with an oscilloscope every day, learning and remembering how to set up advanced triggers for analog troubleshooting can seem daunting. Keysight’s Infiniium EXR- and MXR-Series oscilloscopes have a new feature called Fault Hunter, which sets up advanced triggers aimed at finding random, easily missed signal errors. Fault Hunter makes advanced troubleshooting easier."

Military strategies generally did not include electronic warfare (EW) threats, such as jamming the adversary’s communications or pinpointing their location for a successful attack. As technology became more available and affordable, however, adversaries small to large gained EW capabilities. Now, these threats grow more sophisticated and unpredictable, based largely on their ability to \"learn\" and adapt."

            "content": "Welcome back to the Spectrum Analysis Basics blog series! In part 4, I went over video filtering and trace averaging. This time, I’ll explain time gating. Time-gated spectrum analysis enables you to obtain spectral information about signals that occupy the same part of the frequency spectrum but differ in the time domain. This describes that two or more signals are in the same frequency channel that are active at different times. Using an external trigger signal to coordinate the separation of these signals, you can measure any one of the signals separated in time. You can also measure the spectrum of a signal in one time slot of a time division multiple access (TDMA) system and exclude the spectrum of interfering signals."

Originally, Trickbot was used as a Banking Trojan and most recently we have seen Trickbot turned into a delivery mechanism for anything from a remote access toolkit (RAT), crypto-mining, intellectual property and data exfiltration, and ransomware (See CISA Alert). With our December Threat Simulator Endpoint update, we have included a detailed Trickbot Assessment. With this new Assessment, you can safely simulate Trickbot and determine your preparedness should you be hit with Trickbot or similar malware. Read on to learn more about how this crafty and malicious threat can compromise your network. We will publish more details in future blogs. If you want to know more now, you can sign up for a free trial of Threat Simulator. There you can read the details of the Assessment and learn how effective your security defenses are against Trickbot and many other threats impacting the cyber world."

We certainly utilize this approach at Keysight with a robust college intern recruiting and post-graduation hiring program. But the often-overlooked high school intern engagement is another approach Keysight uses to support student development while also identifying potential future employee candidates. In fact, Keysight’s High School internship program was the topic of a recent virtual panel discussion hosted by the Career Technical Education (CTE) Foundation of Sonoma County, CA. The session, attended and viewed by hundreds of local high school students, introduced three current Keysight high school interns who discussed their experiences, along with three Keysight managers who shared their experience with this program. The discussion was insightful for me to understand the real difference companies can make in offering such internships, to both the students and the company."

Of course, there are lots of perspectives to social justice, from distribution of wealth and support for environmental sustainability, to improving the lives of marginalized individuals. While one aspect of computer science for good focuses on the application of technologies to address these opportunities, the 2020 CSEdWeek theme focuses on the need to enable science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) education for underrepresented students — those whom traditionally have limited opportunities to develop computer science knowledge. This is even more dire today given the deepening digital divide being experienced due to the impacts of COVID-19 on classroom education, and is exactly the gap we have been working on through Keysight’s K-12 STEM education programs. Not only do efforts in this area support underrepresented individuals and enable community prosperity, but they also help ensure a continued diverse technology skillset to maintain innovation into the future."

The company announced near-future plans to launch 36 low earth orbit (LEO) satellites. It revealed plans for an eventual constellation of 650, but it reportedly requested approval for nearly double that number. By comparison, SpaceX has launched around 800 satellites and was granted permission for more than 10,000. Project Kuiper, the Amazon LEO entity, gained approval to launch more than 3,000. As these companies race to keep or take the LEO lead, much data will be gathered around performance over the satellite’s lifetime and how to improve it. NASA, for example, just revealed new findings around LEOs and orbital drag."

In short a packet broker is a specialized switch that enables network administrators to supply the traffic needed, and only the traffic needed, to security and analytics tools on the network. A good way to ensure you get good visibility into traffic, get the most out of your tools and ensure smooth operations. Indeed, one of the things you can do with a visibility fabric is to build high availability inline security solutions such that upgrades, patches and the like can be done without having to open up a maintenance window. We'll touch more on that in a later blog post."

With that said, I was reminded in a recent community discussion that such challenges have also brought opportunity. The focus of this discussion was on providing guidance to students, many in their final year of high school, about how today’s adversity may actually help them prepare for the post-pandemic job market. As we talked through this topic it was clear that there are benefits — a virtual silver lining so to speak — from this difficult period for both students and businesses."

Consumers are happily awaiting a host of new features that will enhance social media, entertainment, and myriad other applications. Public safety and military communications stand to benefit from 5G as well, while 5G non-terrestrial networks (NTN) boost connectivity and capabilities for satellite networks. Beyond these applications, however, little consensus has determined how 5G will impact military applications. That uncertainty quickly changed when the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) unveiled $600 million worth of contracts for five separate installations."

            "content": "A frequent challenge in radio frequency (RF) applications is finding the location of some object or device. One common method for doing this is called trilateration, and trilateration locates objects using time-based measurements from sensors as various locations. Unlike triangulation, which relies on precise angle measurements, trilateration uses the time information to calculate distances. It then uses those distances as the radii of circles centered on the sensors (S1, S2, and S3 below)) and finds the intersection of all the circles in the \"Venn diagram\" thus drawn."

Measuring devastation on this scale is no easy task, and the local authorities were too preoccupied with those directly affected by it to conduct larger surveys. NASA’s Advanced Rapid Imaging and Analysis (ARIA) team stepped up to the plate, collecting and analysing satellite-derived synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to map the extent of the damage to the port city, as shown in the image below. This gave response teams a greater understanding of the extent of the damage from a macro perspective, enabling them to identify and focus on the worst hit areas quickly."

Engineers employ complex modulation schemes to improve spectral efficiency and minimize nonlinear amplification in the RF power amplifier. In an earlier post, we discussed that amplitude and phase-shift keying (APSK) improves nonlinear distortion for satellite communications; orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) increases spectral efficiency for high-throughput satellite communications. However, both modulation techniques bring in test challenges — generating and analyzing custom, proprietary modulation schemes. Engineers spend a lot of time to simulate and analyze the custom modulated signals. In this post, we will explore how to generate and analyze custom modulation schemes with flexible software tools that help you reduce time spent on signal simulation and analysis."

That timeline was met this month, allowing the private sector to share spectrum ranging from 3450 to 3550 MHz.

While I was in the car with my mechanic, he explained that the problem was likely worn rear-wheel bearings. His intuition came from years of experience listening to different types of sounds and abrupt sound changes while driving. After he took out the wheels and checked the wheel bearing assemblies, he confirmed that it was the rear-wheel bearings. I was a happy customer."

Insert the diode so that it protects the remote sense connections as well as the primary output connections."

However, satellite channel impairments such as large path losses, delays, and Doppler shifts pose severe challenges to the realization of a satellite network. The modulation techniques for satellite communications require not only faster data rates but also minimizing the impacts of the channel impairments. This post discusses the modulation techniques for modern satellite communications."

Occasionally, we still need to be able to answer questions about a sample of malware that requires manual analysis efforts. There are a lot of specialized tools that exist for performing certain tasks. For example, you may use CFF Explorer to analyze a PE File, unpack an executable, or rebuild an import address table; regshot to identify changes to the registry; and wireshark to closely observe network communication. What they all have in common is they leverage structures and API calls defined within the operating system.

All cells have some self-discharge. This is normal and expected. However, excessive self-discharge is an indicator of underlying defects that could lead to failure later in life. In this posting I will elaborate on determining where the boundary line should lie between what is normal versus what is excessive self-discharge in lithium ion cells. For reference, “Keysight Solutions for Measuring Self-Discharge of Lithium Ion Cells Achieves Revolutionary Reduction in Test Time” (click on title to access) is a worthwhile post to review to learn more about cell self-discharge and its testing."

In some cases, improving one of the five C’s will help another. Robust connectivity will make a device better able to withstand certain types of cybersecurity attacks.

As you finish up watching a movie or show on Netflix, you are served with similar content or the next in the series. You like that as it caters to your interests. Netflix uses context aware technology to improve user experience by extracting contextual metadata. Similarly, the Four Seasons hotel chain is well-known for its legendary customer service, which includes staff addressing each guest by name. How do they do this? They use context-awareness."

Grooming removes unnecessary information and prepares packets for faster processing by security and monitoring tools. I liken packet grooming to the prep work done by the sous-chef in a busy kitchen. Everything is geared to making the head chef super-efficient and to serving the meals as quickly as possible."

In other words, context-awareness is the ability to extract knowledge from or apply knowledge to information. Let’s take an example. As you finish up watching a movie or show on Netflix, you are served with similar content or the next in the series. You like that as it caters to your interests. Netflix uses context aware technology to improve user experience by extracting contextual metadata. Similarly, the Four Seasons hotel chain is well-known for its legendary customer service, which includes staff addressing each guest by name. How do they do this? They use context-awareness."

When real-time protocols like VoIP are added to the mix, traffic burstiness can become noticeable and result in network equipment buffer overloads along with IP packet loss. Burst protection capabilities are necessary to overcome this for lower speed (1 Gigabit Ethernet) monitoring situations. When troubleshooting, you need to see every packet (even under microburst conditions)."

Take this 2013 Goldman Sachs glitch, for example, which sent 16,000 mispriced options orders in less than an hour and cost the company $7 million in fines. Or this 2015 Bloomberg outage that left traders without market data for two and a half hours and postponed billions of pounds worth of bond sales by the British Treasury. With the reliance on technology in today’s trading world, it can be de(b)trimental if the data is wrong. See what I did there?

For network or application visibility, we are talking about removing blind spots that are hiding the ability to readily see (or quantify) the performance of the network and/or the applications running over the network. This visibility is what enables IT to quickly isolate security threats and resolve performance issues; ultimately ensuring the best possible end user experience."

Netflix uses context aware technology to improve user experience by extracting contextual metadata.

Maximum channel bandwidth increases to 100 MHz for FR1 and 400 MHz for FR2. The higher frequencies and wider bandwidths for 5G NR bring in new design and test challenges. One of the major challenges is frequency responses. In this post, I will discuss how to correct frequency responses for signal analysis."

            "content": "As the race to 5G continues for network operators, installation, verification, optimization, and troubleshooting in the field become a reality. The transition from 4G to 5G requires the integration of new technologies, like phased array antennas, massive MIMO, and beamforming, into the existing network infrastructure. This blog introduces four 5G field tests that operators should perform to verify network performance during 5G deployment.1. Path loss characterizationBecause 5G involves shorter, higher-frequency, millimeter-wave (mmWave) signals, it’s more susceptible to degradation during transmission than 4G signals. That means 5G signals are more likely to lose power density as they propagate through space due to several environmental factors like rain, trees, buildings, air quality, and more. This loss in power density is known as path loss.Telecommunications companies must be able to accurately anticipate how mobile users will be affected by path loss in their system. To do this, operators create a link budget that sums all the gains and losses between a transmitter and receiver. This budget is also known as a link budget. To establish a link budget for successful 5G implementation, operators need test equipment that can characterize path loss.2. Base station coverage testing4G base station coverage testing involves scanning receivers with omnidirectional antennas that detect coverage gaps. The receivers log one data point per geolocation and make several measurements in the same location for better statistical results. 5G base station testing, on the other hand, is a little different.5G base stations and mobile phones use phased array antenna technology for massive MIMO and beamforming. Therefore, 5G base station testing requires a spectrum analyzer or a scanning receiver equipped with a phased array antenna, like that pictured in Figure 1. Also, because of the characteristics of 5G mmWave beams, logging one geolocation point is not enough. Field engineers must collect signal power data across azimuth and elevation in addition to geolocation to fully verify base station coverage. Figure 1. Keysight’s FieldFox paired with a phased array antenna for coverage testing3. Over-the-air (OTA) control channel interference testing5G brings several technological advancements to life, and it also brings interference. 5G will operate on some of the same satellite frequency bands used by emergency services. This overlap presents a potential interference problem that can be detrimental.Additionally, adjacent cell towers can cause interference between each other. If interference occurs in the control channel, it can bring the whole cell tower down. So, it is necessary to have a solution in the field kit that detects intermittent interference signals and visualizes control channels.Traditional spectrum analyzers may miss information during deadtime while stitching gathered data blocks together. The best method for interference hunting and visualization is real-time spectrum analysis or RTSA. So, a solution that performs RTSA measurements, like that shown in Figure 2, is ideal for interference management. Figure 2. A control channel with interference measured using FieldFox’s RTSA mode4. EMF exposure evaluationMany countries have strict regulations on the amount of electromagnetic field (EMF) radiation that a transmitter can emit. These regulations ensure a safe environment for the public and workers because high EMF radiation is linked to serious health issues like cancer. Figure 3 shows well-known sources of EMF radiation and their corresponding frequency bands. Figure 3. EMF radiation sources and their corresponding frequencies5G mmWave signals have different electromagnetic field (EMF) properties than previous standards. And because mmWave signals degrade over distance, more antennas have to go up to support 5G. This increase and change in EMF exposure require network operators to verify EMF levels in the field for safety and compliance. To measure EMF levels, field engineers need a spectrum analyzer that tests total field strength across frequency bands of interest. Solutions that have pass/fail limits integrated into the measurement make EMF readings even easier.5G is the next technology revolution, but there are several challenges associated with its successful deployment in the field. If you’re looking to make the leap to 5G, make sure you’re familiar with these field tests and make sure you have the proper test equipment so that your transition is as smooth as possible.For a deeper dive into the tests discussed in this blog plus other necessary tests like component carrier power measurements, network quality validation, and beam performance verification, read the eBook Six Essential 5G Field Tests Using FieldFox Handheld Analyzers.Keysight’s FieldFox handheld analyzer can perform all of the tests described in this blog, plus more. It has over twenty measurement functions including cable and antenna test, spectrum analysis, network analysis, and power measurements."

            "content": "PCIe is a core technology used in many types of computer servers and endpoint devices. PCIe is scalable, and slots come in different configurations of bidirectional lanes: x1, x4, x8, x16, x32. The number represents the number of lanes in the PCIe slot. For example, a PCIe x1 slot provides one lane and transmits data at 1 bit per cycle. A PCIe x2 slot provides two lanes and transmits data at 2 bits per cycle, and so on. PCIe cards fit interchangeably into slots, but the bandwidth available depends upon the version of the PCIe standard of the card.The PCI Special Interest Group (PCI-SIG®) defines specifications and compliance tests that ensure the interoperability of PCIe systems. The PCIe standard evolved from PCIe 1.0, released in 2003 supporting 2.5 gigatransfers per second (GT/s), to PCIe 5.0, released in 2019 supporting 32 GT/s. Figure 1 shows the evolution of the standard and the bandwidth doubling with each generation. Figure 1: Evolution of the PCIe standardSummary of the StandardsIn PCIe 2.0, the bit rate is 5 GT/s, but with the 20% performance overhead of the 8b/10b encoding scheme, the delivered bandwidth is 4 Gb/s. PCIe 3.0 and later versions use more efficient 128b/130b encoding, whittling the overhead down to a modest 1.5%. By removing this overhead, the interconnect bandwidth doubled to 8 Gb/s with the implementation of the PCIe 3.0 specification while preserving compatibility with version 2.0 software and mechanical interfaces. With full backward compatibility, PCIe 3.0 provides the same topologies and channel reach for client and server configurations as in PCIe 2.0.PCIe 1.x and 2.x cards seamlessly plug into PCIe 3.0-capable slots, and vice versa, operating at the highest performance levels supported by those configurations. The PCIe 3.0 specifications comprise the Base and Card Electromechanical (CEM) specifications. The electrical section of the PCIe 3.0 Base Specification defines electrical performance at the integrated circuit (IC) level and supports 8 GT/s signaling.The PCIe 3.0 standard added receiver equalization and transmitter de-emphasis tests, which are critical for success at 8 GT/s and above. Equalization can occur at the transmitter, the receiver, or both. PCIe 1.x and PCIe 2.x specify a simple form of equalization called transmitter de-emphasis. De-emphasis reduces the low-frequency energy seen by the receiver. Equalization reduces the effects of greater channel loss at high frequencies. Receiver equalization implementation requires various types of algorithms; the two most common are linear and decision feedback (DFE). Transmitter de-emphasis equalization occurs at the transmitter, while DFE equalization occurs at the receiver. Receiver equalization at the receiver can also include continuous-time linear equalization (CTLE) in combination with the DFE.The PCIe 4.0 standard (Gen 4) debuted in 2017, seven years after completion of PCIe 3.0. Compared with its predecessor, Gen 4 doubled the data rate from 8 to 16 Gb/s. Gen 4 architecture is compatible with prior generations of the technology, from software to clocking architecture to mechanical interfaces. From a protocol and encoding standpoint, Gen 4 looks a lot like PCIe Gen 3, sharing many elements in common, including 128/130-bit encoding. At first glance, Gen 4 has more in common with Gen 3 than Gen 3 does with Gen 2. But when you increase the speed of the device, you are automatically sending higher frequencies through the same channel. Insertion loss, or attenuation caused by resistance in the link during electrical signal transmission, increases with higher frequency rates.The PCI-SIG released the PCIe 5.0 specification in May 2019. The fast release of the Gen 5 interface, completed in less than two years, was a welcome change after the seven-year wait for PCIe 4.0. PCIe 5.0 doubles the transfer rate once again, reaching 32 GT/s while maintaining low power and backward compatibility with previous generations. Gen 5 promises up to 128 GB/s of throughput via an x16 configuration, enabling 400GE speeds in the data center. Together, 400GE speeds and PCIe 5.0 enable applications such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, gaming, visual computing, storage, and networking. These advances allow users to drive innovation in 5G, cloud computing, and hyperscale data centers.Different types of test equipment must perform different categories of tests from design to first prototypes (Refer to Figure 2): Figure 2: PCIe physical layer test with oscilloscopes, BERTs, and protocol analyzersEach generation of the PCIe standard doubled the data transfer rate and increased the complexity of test. Regardless of which generation of the standard you are working on, you need a test solution approved by PCI-SIG to ensure that your products comply with the standard and get to market faster. Keysight provides a total-solution approach to test all generations of the PCIe standard, so you can focus on your next design, rather than spending time learning the details of the test procedures and requirements.

            "content": "In my previous post “Controlling Test Automation-The Easy Way”, I shared how the FlexiCore Handler system allows control over the test operation yet maintains the safety interlocks and operation integrity. Now let’s dive into the Handler Control Panel this time and take a closer look at how to achieve this.Socket connection over TCP/IP networkNot familiar with socket connections? It is not as complicated as it sounds, and there are tons of information available on the web to bring you up to speed. Socket connection is a peer-to-peer connection method to link between different software applications within a local area network environment. Software needs just the IP address and the port number in order to link up and talk to each other.Handler Control Panel application maintains a server in the background of the PC and listens in on a specific port number 5045. It waits for any software clients to connect into this port. Connected clients can then send commands to the Handler Control Panel to control handler operations and manage the handling of units under test (UUT). Fig1 : Four stages of Handler Operation SequenceThere are four stages in the handler’s operation. Each stage consists of a set of pre-defined sequences which does not allow you to make any alterations. This upholds the safety integrity of the system.Initialization happens at the beginning of the test operation, while the rest of the three stages will work in a continuous loop thereafter. Each stage of these operation can be associated with a command listed in Table1 below. Table1 : Handler Operation CommandsNow let’s look at the commands for each of the stages.InitializationThe Initialize command SfpH:Init sent at any time during an operation cycle will put the handler back into Initialization stage. This is useful when the handler gets into an error state and stop or when the testplan needs to reset its operation. After completion of the Initialization process, the handler will remain in idle state until the next command is issued.InputThe command SfpH:ToFirstRun sets the handler into the Input stage sequence. This begins the test operation cycle. The sequence starts with an Initialization sequence followed with the handler bringing in the UUT and moving it into position before engaging it down onto the test fixture. This completes the input stage, and the handler waits for the next instruction.TestThe handler sets it’s AutoStart flag to indicate that the UUT is ready for testing when the press is fully engaged. The user’s testplan queries this flag with the command SpfH:ChkAutoStart? to determine if it should start the testing or programming sequences. The sequence of test and programming will be application specific.OutputAfter testplan completes the tests on the UUT, it sets the UUT with a Pass or Fail result. Sending the Set Result command SfpH:SetRslt “n” sets the result and triggers the Output stage sequence to release the UUT and transfer it to the downstream machine. Along with the transfer, handler sets the Pass/Fail signal to the downstream machine so that appropriate handling can take place thereafter.This completes one entire test cycle and the handler automatically returns to the Input Stage waiting for the next UUT to be available. That’s it! Four commands are all it takes to get the handler moving!Of course, this is only the basic operation and, on the assumption, that there are no error conditions. To put this into actual production use, the testplan needs to include the checks for handler error so that the operation will not be stuck in an infinite loop when the handler stops on an error. We will talk about Error handling in the next post.Stay tuned and stay healthy!Ping me up with your questions or comments !kwan-wee_lee@keysight.com"

            "content": "The 5G New Radio (NR) standard offers the potential for increased data rates by using higher-order modulation, wider modulation bandwidths at higher millimeter-wave (mmWave) frequencies, and multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) technology.While MIMO is complex for 4G and wireless local area network (WLAN), it can be significantly more complex for 5G NR in the frequency range 2 (FR2) band because of wide modulation bandwidths at mmWave frequencies. As you migrate from single-antenna single-input/single-output (SISO) implementations to two-channel MIMO, a multitude of design and testing challenges emerge that impact peak data rates and make it difficult to troubleshoot and debug hardware performance issues.Ensuring optimal performance in a multichannel MIMO implementation requires comprehensive multichannel MIMO measurements, such as error vector magnitude (EVM), a key metric for transmitter performance. Radio frequency (RF) and baseband impairments such as timing errors, local oscillator (LO) phase noise, power amplifier gain/phase distortion, and intermediate frequency (IF)/RF filter group delay can degrade transmitter EVM.In addition, propagation loss at mmWave frequencies necessitates the use of phased-array technology and beam steering to achieve enough signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and link quality for 5G NR and other emerging applications such as 802.11ay. This adds a layer of complexity in validating mmWave MIMO system performance under real-world scenarios.Your testbed should take into consideration the following 3 factors to address these challenges:1. Extreme bandwidthsEmerging high-band mmWave applications demand extreme bandwidths. 802.11ay, for example, specifies a two-channel bonded configuration for 2 * 2.16 GHz, or 4.32 GHz of channel bandwidth. This standard also specifies other optional channel bonding configurations for 6.48 GHz and 8.64 GHz of channel bandwidth, as well as some channel aggregation configurations. In addition, standards bodies are considering an optional MIMO feature for 802.11ay.Your MIMO measurement testbed needs to be flexible and scalable enough to address a multitude of frequency bands, extreme frequency bandwidths, and multiple channels to address demanding emerging mmWave test challenges. Keysight’s R&D mmWave testbed uses a new ultra-performance, real-time, 110 GHz oscilloscope (UXR) to directly digitize and analyze wide-bandwidth, high-frequency mmWave signals.Figure 1. 5G NR 28 GHz MIMO test setup2. Phase NoiseLow phase noise is essential for making accurate mmWave measurements. MIMO measurements require a low-phase-noise clock distributed to multiple channels without degradation. The length (10 mS) and wide bandwidth (800 MHz) of 5G NR mmWave signals demand a measurement with both excellent close-in phase noise and high-offset phase noise. Broadband noise increases with bandwidth by 10 * log (BW increase). Phase noise increases with center frequency (CF) by 20 * log (CF increase). Moving a 5G carrier from 3 to 39 GHz will therefore increase phase noise by more than 22 dB, if there is no improvement in the frequency reference.Consider the instruments in your MIMO test setup carefully to address this challenge. Keysight’s test setup uses the new UXR oscillocope, which has the low noise, wide bandwidth, multiple channels, and flat frequency response to measure 5G NR MIMO mmWave signals. It also features a clean 8 GHz clock (–130 dBc/Hz @ 100 kHz offset) and distributes this to all four channels. The clock is then multiplied up to 128 GHz for the samplers to collect data at 256 GSa/s. This fixed multiplication chain allows the use of proprietary Keysight amplifiers and filters to nearly eliminate phase noise beyond the 20 * log (CF increase).Fixed multiplication maintains tight coherency between channels. The jitter added by making multiple channel measurements over single channel measurements is specified as < 10 fs rms. A 39 GHz carrier run into two channels of a UXR, measured with 1 GHz instantaneous BW, will show < 1/2 deg rms of jitter between them.This performance makes the UXR a good choice for mmWave EVM measurements and enables excellent phase noise measurements. Multiple channels and cross-correlation remove the noise contribution of the channels, generating very low-noise, very wide (many gigahertz) offset phase noise measurements.Figure 3. UXR phase noise measurements3. SpeedHigh signal fidelity and a low noise floor measurement require a high sample rate for signal acquisition. The slow processing speed of high sample rates makes an oscilloscope with standard hardware inadequate for 5G NR EVM measurements. Oversampling results in a more accurate and lower EVM result but increases the EVM demodulation processing time.Once again, consider the instruments in your MIMO test setup carefully. Keysight’s UXR oscilloscope hardware supports a technique called digital down conversion (DDC) that enables the high-frequency content of an RF signal to be appropriately down-sampled before storing it in the oscilloscope memory.The oscilloscope hardware first applies a bandpass filter to a user-specified frequency span that prevents out-of-band noise from aliasing into the passband region during the down-sampling process. Half-band decimators perform frequency shifting and decimation of the data.Smaller frequency spans enable more decimation to be applied, resulting in lower output sample rates and less data being stored to memory than would be required when capturing the full sample rate data record. This smaller data size also requires less data transfer and post-processing time.The UXR oscilloscope hardware supports a series of discrete frequency spans, ranging from 40 MHz to 2.16 GHz. The VSA software can calculate measurements such as EVM several orders of magnitude faster than it could on a full sample rate data record.Figure 3. DDC feature on the UXR oscilloscope captures and decimates signals into memory for VSA processing.Learn more about making quick and accurate phase-coherent MIMO measurements by downloading Keysight’s application note MIMO and Wideband Millimeter-Wave Testing with the UXR Application Note available on the 5G Network Equipment Manufacturers webpage."

            "content": "Keysight continues to support customers by sharing our expertise and developing products that help solve real-world problems. Cybersecurity issues such as ransomware, malware, and DDoS attacks continue to weigh heavy on the minds of security and networking professionals in 2020.Keysight Tackles Security Operations EffectivenessSecurity operations (SecOps) teams are faced with a very complicated network infrastructure to protect what is on-premises, in private data centers, and in the cloud. They invest a lot of resources – both time and money – in security solutions to protect their organizations.Keysight recently conducted a Security Operations Effectiveness survey which illustrated some of the issues that SecOps teams face in today’s complex environment. One key take-away is that security professionals may be overconfident in their security tools as only 50% of respondents reported that they have experienced a security breach because one or more of their security solutions was not working as expected.Security testing such as penetration testing is often performed once a year and represents how a security infrastructure performs at that point in time. Unfortunately, security conditions can change from day to day as new attacks develop and old ones evolve in a very fluid threat environment.In order to help customers deal with the highly dynamic security environment, Keysight launched a new family of solutions, Breach Defense, to help customers continuously test their security posture. Launched at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, Keysight's Scott Register took to the stage at the show to discuss a new product in the platform, Threat Simulator, which joined ThreatARMOR, the threat intelligence gateway. Both products leverage the threat intelligence provided by Keysight’s Application and Threat Intelligence Research Center which has 15 years’ experience developing a large database of exploits, DoS, DDoS, phishing, live malware, and applications, real-time cloud threat intelligence, evasion techniques, application profiles, and a global IP address database.Threat Simulator provides SecOps teams a way to test security tools to determine their effectiveness. It provides a continuous, automated security assessment of end-to-end production network security infrastructures, enabling SecOps teams to quickly spot gaps such as security configurations that are left open. A patented recommendation engine provides clear remediation steps to the misconfiguration or vulnerability.Keysight Brings Expertise to Network Security ProfessionalsRecently, we took the opportunity to share our security expertise with IT professionals at conferences around the world.Mark Pierpoint, president, Keysight’s Network Applications & Security group, recently participated in a panel, Surviving the Breach, Incident Response Beyond Plan A with other security leaders at the Global Cybersecurity Forum in Dubai. Mark discussed how Keysight helps customers around the world not only respond to attacks, but also how to deploy a resilient network monitoring infrastructure to gain visibility into their networks to find anomalies on their networks faster, recover faster, and minimize business disruption.Also at RSA, Keysight gathered together security experts for a special panel, “Are Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Being Used Against You – And Is It Too Late to Stop It?” The session, moderated by Keysight security expert Phil Trainor, featured Diana Kelley, Microsoft cybersecurity CTO, Sean Cordero, head of Cloud Strategy for Netskope, Justin Harvey, Global Managing Director of Accenture, and Chris Morales, head of security analytics at Vectra. While the human element was the theme of the RSA conference, the session focused on how AI and machine learning might be used by hackers and potential ways to protect organizations and individuals (humans) against potential threats.Keysight Recognized for SecurityWe are proud and honored that our efforts were recognized at the RSA Conference with a Cyber Defense InfoSec Award in the Next Gen, Network Security and Management category. The award recognized Keysight’s ongoing commitment to helping our customers protect their organizations from cyberattack. “Keysight embodies three major features the judges look for to become winners: understanding tomorrow’s threats, today, providing a cost-effective solution and innovating in unexpected ways that can help stop the next breach,” said Gary S. Miliefsky, publisher of Cyber Defense Magazine."

            "content": "Welcome to the world of 5G. In that world, networks will heavily utilize millimeter-Wave frequency spectrum bands. These bands, above 24 GHz, have the ability to support large bandwidths and high throughput. As the number of users with cell phones, connected cars, and other wireless devices increases, the capacity of the network must follow.You may have heard of some people protesting mmWave and 5G development. Do these protests or even hesitations have substance, or should we catapult into the newest wireless communication technology? Below, I’ll explain 4 of the most common myths regarding mmWave, if you should believe them, and if the concerns are valid, what we can do to mitigate issues.Let's get started.Myth Number 1: mmWave frequencies will harm your healthYes, cell phone towers and cell phones emit radiation. However, there are a few different types of radiation: non-ionizing, which comes from our electronics, and ionizing, which comes from the sun or medical imaging machines like X-rays. It is true that the higher the frequency, the more potential harm can be done, but mmWave frequencies (24 GHz to 300 GHz) don’t fall in to the non-ionizing radiation category. More research needs to be done to fully understand the effect of this frequency range on humans, but for now, there’s no need to panic. While there may be some radiation exposure, you actually get a decent amount of your daily radiation dose from eating a banana, but no one fears their daily smoothie...Myth Number 2: mmWave won’t be able to travel through wallsHaving a high frequency means having a short wavelength. This means that the waves see a little more trouble when passing through objects, such as walls, your body, trees, etc. So, honestly, this one is pretty much true. However, don’t lose hope for the mmWave and 5G revolution just yet. By now, you have probably heard of small cell deployment. Smaller base stations will provide more dense areas of cellular coverage, compensating for the short wavelengths' inability to travel long distances.Another possible solution to this is that 5G mmWave networks can cover outdoor usage and indoor usage separately, but we may need to brainstorm new ways to cover indoor to outdoor (and vice versa) coverage. And while this may seem like an issue, it actually could increase efficient spectrum use. We could potentially reuse bands when out of range, decreasing the number of bands needed.Myth Number 3: The terms mWave and 5G can be used interchangablyWe’ll start with 5G, since that’s why so many people are interested in mmWave. While the two are closely related, 5G will use many more technologies than just mmWave. mmWave helps to increase the bandwidth available for cellular networks by breaking in to the above 24 GHz range, allowing for more high data rate spectrum usage. However, 5G also utilizes the sub-6 GHz spectrum. mmWave high frequencies can propagate information much faster but are easily blocked. Lower frequencies can travel long distances but transmit data more slowly. mmWave is a crucial component of the explosion of 5G development and is necessary for meeting the promises of ultra-fast networks, but there’s still more to 5G. The phrases aren’t interchangeable, but most often can be used together.Myth Number 4: mmWave will be used only for cellular communicationNot true! These high frequency waves have use cases across the board. From image processing to medical research, mmWave provides a new frequency band for innovation across the board. For example, mmWaves are used in explosive detection due to the ability of the short wavelength to travel through the human body. The reflected waves can be used by an imaging system to estimate sizes and shapes of concealed objects. While the exact type of object wouldn’t be obvious, the images created can at least detect unexpected concealed objects.Other applications, such as video transmission, will improve greatly. Wireless video transmission, such as from a laptop to a TV or wireless HD projectors, will be supported by mmWave technologies. The wireless capabilities don’t stop there – a PCI express wireless version is already available, and some companies have expressed interest in developing a wireless USB 3.0. Chip-to-chip wireless links would also be made possible, allowing device design breakthroughs.Many other applications utilize the high frequency bands of millimeter wave frequencies. Astronomists use this band for telescope imaging. This satellite-based remote sensing helps identify oxygen particle radiation in the upper atmosphere, which helps scientists predict and measure temperature. Radar also heavily utilizes mmWave bands, especially for short-range applications. This radar helps in shooting down missiles, tracking beams of bullets, and more.With these things in mind, testing and avoiding issues becomes an integral part of development. Knowing how your 5G device will respond to specific environments or stimulus can help make your design more robust once it’s deployed. Using software like PathWave Vector Signal Analysis (89600 VSA) (now with even more powerful capabilities!) or Pathwave X-Series Measurement Applications on a signal analyzer gives you a window into the mmWave spectrum. These software applications are best used with a Keysight Signal analyzer paired with a high-frequency signal generator, such as pairing analyzers like the MXA or UXA with the VXG signal generator."

            "content": "The global spread of COVID-19 is unprecedented in modern times, affecting individuals, communities and businesses worldwide. From a corporate perspective, companies are frantically managing their business response, engaging continuity plans and navigating a complex and highly volatile landscape of business aspects. Keysight is no different, with our Global Crisis Management Team (GCMT) and other key personnel working exhaustingly long hours to ensure employee health and safety, as well as continued support of our customers, shareholders, suppliers and communities. What I find inspiring about the extraordinary work of our GCMT in these difficult times is the fact that it is primarily led by Keysight women leaders, and the coincidence that this is Women's History Month is not lost on me.Keysight’s global crisis response is led by our GCMT, which interfaces across more than 120 company sites in 30 countries, through both country- and site-level crisis management teams (CMTs) staffed by local company leaders and functional team members trained in response procedures. In fact, I lead our Santa Rosa headquarters site CMT and am also a member of the core GCMT. It has been quite an experience to be a part of the worldwide mobilization that this team has orchestrated from the early days of the virus spread. The GCMT engaged soon after the first cases of COVID-19 began appearing in Wuhan Province in China, where the company has a small office. Initially focused on cross-China response, as the virus spread, so did our alignment with additional country- and site-CMTs, reaching a crescendo with the government mandates across Europe, the U.S.A. and other regions just last week.After several days of unrestrained 100%+ engagement with our crisis management teams, I just recently had a few minutes to pause, look at my normal work duties and catch up on some eMail. This is when I realized it was already late-March, more than halfway through Women’s History Month. It then occurred to me that the leadership team of Keysight’s GCMT – the team that works expeditiously and tirelessly in support of employee safety and security, while maintaining business continuity during crisis events -- was predominantly driven by women leaders!Our GCMT has 12 members, 8 of whom are women, including the team leadership. Ingrid Estrada, Keysight’s Senior Vice President, Chief Administrative Officer and Chief of Staff, heads up our GCMT as the executive sponsor. Through her broad business experience and responsibilities across human resources, workplace strategies, global sourcing and internal company operations, she is well-positioned to address the dynamic situations that crises have on corporate functions. Claire McCarthy, just recently named Keysight Director of Global Sustainability, Security & Safety, is the GCMT Incident Command Manager and a critical leader on the team, with connections across multiple functional organizations. The other women playing a critical role on the GCMT are from Workplace Solutions, Human Resources, Legal and Communications. In addition, there are many more women either leading the site CMTs or acting as site Incident Commanders.And, unfortunately, COVID-19 is not the team's first engagement. Having managed through wildfire impacts, power outages and other events over the last few years, this team is seasoned at crisis management. Which also uniquely positions the team, and the company, to benefit from past learnings in support of continuous improvement.As I sit back in awe of the most recent efforts and results of this team, paired with the realization of Women’s History Month, I can’t help but think how these women have become part of Keysight’s legacy through their strategic contributions to our business continuity. They will forever be in my mind as having made not only a significant impact, but history of their own as well."

            "content": "Every year we look forward to eating pie on pi day to celebrate the simple yet infinitely complex number we all know and love. This year’s pie excitement got me thinking about all the other important numbers in my life. Why shouldn’t they also get holidays?Let's look at four numbers that have been very near and dear to me and countless other engineers.The Boltzmann Constant relates the kinetic energy of particles with the temperature of the particles. You’ve probably plugged this important constant into your calculator hundreds of times whether you’re an electrical engineer, chemical engineer, or mechanical engineer. In electrical test and measurement, thermal excitation of electrons is extremely important to consider, and it’s why your test area should be kept at a constant temperature.Boltzmann’s studies of the collisions of particles led to his statistical definition of the second law of thermodynamics. By thinking of particles in a gas as billiard balls in a box, Boltzmann observed that the particles would trend toward a state of maximum disorder, or entropy. To honor Boltzmann, create some entropy of your own. Rearrange your desk. Wear mismatched socks. Do something new. The Boltzmann constant is 1.380649×10−23 J/K. We’ll use the exponent as the date for the holiday, so Boltzmann day is 10-23 or October 23rd. Or maybe some of you should take the opportunity to reduce the entropy of your workspaceWe started with the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, and now we’re in the Silicon Age. Silicon’s unique semiconductor properties enabled groundbreaking compact transistor technology, bringing us all the electronic devices we use today. Anyone with an electrical engineering background has spent hours studying the physical and electrical properties of silicon, and what property is more significant than the electrical band gap?The 1.12 eV band gap of silicon will be celebrated on January 12th (1-12) by eating layered cake. The frosting on the cake is like an oxide layer in silicon, so a layered cake is like a giant silicon wafer. You can even dope your cake with sprinkles! All we need is some bias points and we've got a delicious transistorIn the early days of quantum mechanics, physicists observed both particle and wave properties in light. So is light waves or particles? Turns out the answer is yes to both. Max Planck calculated a relationship between the energy carried by photons and their frequency, answering some of the questions that classical physics failed to address in high-frequency black body radiation. Planck’s Constant is a critical piece of electrical and optical engineering and should be programmed into every engineer’s calculator.Before he was a Nobel-prize winning physicist, Planck was a gifted musician. So, to honor Planck’s Constant Day, we will dust of our old guitars and keyboards and work the creative sides of our brains through music. Planck’s Constant day will fall on Planck’s birthday – April 23rd.I’m going to stretch the rules a little for this one. Even though Maxwell’s equations are a set of equations and not a specific number, these equations are the bread and butter of electrical engineering, right up there with Ohm’s Law. By bringing photonics, magnetism, and electricity together, Maxwell’s equations are not only a pillar of modern physics, but they also represent the culmination of the work of several brilliant minds including Gauss, Faraday, and Ampere.James Clerk Maxwell was insatiably curious his entire life. His curiosity led to some of the most important breakthroughs physics has ever seen. On Maxwell’s birthday (June 13th), celebrate his legacy by learning something new. Google a question that’s been on your mind. Get lost in a Wikipedia rabbit hole. Maybe you’ll make a breakthrough of your own.When I studied engineering I was fascinated at the effort that had gone into deriving every equation I used. The people these constants are named after are engineering rock stars, and it was an incredible experience to see how so many people’s lifelong efforts culminated into the modern science I studied. So let’s celebrate their efforts!"

            "content": "The theme for this year’s International Women’s Day was ‘an equal world is an enabled world.’ As well as celebrating women’s achievements, the day is also a call to action to raise awareness against gender bias and accelerate efforts to realize equality globally. While we’ve made strong progress over the last three decades, real change is still happening too slowly, especially in the technology sector.According to the National Center for Women & IT, just 26% of professional computing occupations are held by women. What’s more, computing and IT education is not attracting diverse talent. Only 19% of those who received a computing degree in 2017 were female, down from 27% in 1997. The Center also notes that a high percentage of women already employed in the technology sector are leaving their roles, so diversity is not being maintained and nurtured.These are issues we need to address urgently, for several reasons:\n• Diversity is good for business. A report by McKinsey showed that companies with more diverse executive teams perform better, are more profitable, have more engaged employees, and retain those employees better\n• Diversity is good for overall economic prosperity. According to the European Commission, if more women were to choose careers in the ICT sector, it could create an annual GDP boost of €16 billion for the European economy\n• Diversity is good for everyone. Greater diversity drives companies to develop new solutions and services which can benefit the largest number of people, not just a specific section of societyKeysight is taking action in three key areas to support and accelerate the drive for equality. We provide ongoing development opportunities for Keysight’s female employees; we highlight and provide opportunities for girls and young women in STEM education, from school to post-graduate level; and we support women in our local communities across the globe.As well as the extensive range of online learning and leadership programs available to all Keysight staff, we have specific programs focused on developing women employees. These include internal networking groups and mentorships, and membership of industry associations such as the Society of Women Engineers (SWE). Our Keysight Society of Women Engineers Program pays for employee SWE memberships worldwide, helping to support the success and advancement of female engineers.Developing tomorrow’s engineers and innovators is a key impact goal for us. In 2014, we committed to engage 570,000 students and future engineers in STEM education by the end of our fiscal year 2020. We are well on track to exceed that target, with over 445,000 students engaged by the end of fiscal 2018. Our educational outreach covers primary schools to post-grad levels, and features many initiatives focused on engaging girls and young women. A prime example is Keysight’s support of the annual Introduce a Girl to Engineering Day, which brings STEM concepts to grade-school students and helps girls develop an interest in engineering and IT.Community outreach and support is core to Keysight’s CSR activities globally. This means our executives and employees take their support for developing diversity into the communities around our offices and facilities worldwide. For example, Keysight employees founded the Community WISE (Women Investing in STEM Equity) program run by the Career Technical Education (CTE) Foundation of Sonoma County, California. Community WISE focuses on engaging local women in technology development and providing resources to enable every woman to realize their potential in STEM careers.As a woman in tech myself, I am committed to helping Keysight maintain and grow its reputation for being a Great Place to Work for every one of our employees. It’s particularly gratifying that FORTUNE magazine again placed Keysight in its 2019 listing of the 100 Best Workplaces for Diversity. With a truly open and inclusive workplace, we can nurture the next generation of female leaders, who will in turn further advance gender equality, to enable and benefit everyone."

High-performance oscilloscopes respond with increased sample rates, lower noise, and more bandwidth so you can analyze today’s more advanced and demanding signals. However, as sample rates increase, the amount of time an oscilloscope can capture in its available memory depth decreases. Memory depth is measurable in points — each digital sample results in a point of memory. Therefore, each doubling in sample rate results in half of the memory storage capacity."

            "content": "Multiple-input/multiple-out (MIMO) technology is an established wireless communications technique for sending and receiving multiple data signals simultaneously over the same radio channel. MIMO techniques play a prominent role in Wi-Fi communications, as well as 3G, 4G, and 4G LTE networks.\n\n5G New Radio, however, takes it to the next level, introducing the concept of massive MIMO, which — as the name implies — involves the application of MIMO technology on a much larger scale for greater network coverage and capacity. Massive MIMO uses many more transmit and receive antennas to increase transmission gain and spectral efficiency. To achieve massive MIMO capacity gain, multiple UEs must generate downlink traffic simultaneously. Many variables impact the actual gain provided by massive MIMO.\n\nWhile there is no specific minimum number of antennas required for the application of massive MIMO, the generally accepted threshold for a system is more than eight transmit and eight receive antennas. And the number can be much higher, extending to systems with tens or even hundreds of antennas.\n\nMassive MIMO — along with smart antenna techniques such as beamforming and beam steering — are among the key technologies for enabling the higher throughput and capacity gains promised by 5G. And they are essential for delivering the 100x data rates and the 1,000x capacity goals specified in the International Mobile Telecommunications-2020 (IMT-2020) vision.\n\nSince massive MIMO uses many more antennas than the number of UEs in the cell, the beam is much narrower, enabling the base station to deliver RF energy to the UE more precisely and efficiently. The antenna's phase and gain are controlled individually, with the channel information remaining with the base station, simplifying UE without adding multiple receiver antennas. Installation of a large number of base station antennas will increase the signal-to-noise ratio in the cell, which leads to higher cell site capacity and throughput. Since 5G massive MIMO implementation is on mmWave frequencies, the antennas required are small and easy to install and maintain."

This blog discusses two important power measurements you should be able to make with the tools in your field kit: channel power and adjacent channel power."

From delivery of communications like fifth-generation (5G) cellular to security and streaming applications, next-generation satellite networks will enable the transformation and creation of many applications. The success of all communications systems depends on performance, however. One important indicator of performance is noise power ratio (NPR) – particularly in satellite systems, which need to limit their power consumption. The distortion testing of radio-frequency (RF) amplifiers offers one method to gain insight into NPR."

It seems like only yesterday that I attended the first edition, but I admit that my memory of the proceedings and exhibits has faded. What I do recall is that back in the mid-nineties, chip and system designers were making the transition to language-based methods and the issue of the day was design verification. Design complexity was increasing dramatically with the new abstraction level and the amount of time engineers had to spend in functional verification was skyrocketing. There wasn’t enough time in the design cycle or verification resources to finish all the tests needed to ensure success."
