Does the government have to select the custodian? Is a written contract needed?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—A securities custodian is the government's agent if it acts as the representative of the government to protect the government's rights in the securities. In evaluating whether the custodian is the government's agent, the preparer should examine the conditions under which the custodian will release the securities. Factors of (a) who selects the custodian and (b) written evidence may provide additional evidence of an agency relationship.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Releasing Securities:</b> The function of a custodial agent is to hold and release securities. To determine whether the custodian is the government's agent, one should determine whether the custodian acts at the direction of the government in holding and releasing securities. The more important of these two functions is the release of securities because improper release can expose the government to risk of loss.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">A custodian that is the government's agent will release the government's investment securities to the government or to someone else at the government's direction without having to obtain approval from anyone else. Further, the government's custodial agent will not release the securities to someone other than the government without the government's approval. A custodian that releases securities owned by the government at someone else's direction and without the government's approval is not acting as the government's agent.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The conditions for release of collateral or repurchase agreement securities pledged to the government differ from the conditions for release of securities owned by the government. This difference is because both the pledgee government and the pledgor counterparty have rights in the securities. A custodian that is the government's agent will not release the securities to the pledgor counterparty or to someone else at the pledgor's direction unless the government (a) approves, (b) informs the custodian it has completed its transaction with the pledgor counterparty, or (c) commits an act of default. Because of the pledgor counterparty's rights in the securities, however, a custodian that is the government's agent probably also will not release the securities to the government or to someone else at the government's direction unless the pledgor counterparty also (a) approves or (b) commits an act of default. This requirement for the custodian also to protect the rights of the pledgor counterparty does not necessarily diminish the fact that the custodian is the government's agent. (See further discussion of three-party custodial arrangements in Questions <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_98" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_98">1.36.1</span> and <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_120" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_120">1.53.1</span>.) If a custodian will release collateral or repurchase agreement securities to the pledgor counterparty without the approval of the government, the custodian is not acting as the government's agent, even if the government subsequently is informed of the release.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Often, a collateral pledge agreement or repurchase agreement permits the pledgor to substitute securities of equal or greater value with the custodian without the specific approval of the pledgee government. Such a situation would not change the fact that the custodian is the government's agent because the collateral pledge or repurchase agreement constitutes the government's prior approval for the release of the securities. However, if the custodian permits substitution by the pledgor counterparty in the absence of the government's current or prior approval, evidence that the custodian is the government's agent would be diminished or eliminated.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Selection of Custodian:</b> The government's selection of the custodian would provide additional evidence that the custodian is the government's agent. However, a custodian that is not selected by the government may still be the government's agent. For example, the custodian for a <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">tri-party repurchase agreement</b> program usually is selected by the repurchase agreement counterparty. However, the tri-party custodial agreement establishes the custodian as agent both of the government and of the repurchase agreement counterparty. On the other hand, the government's selection of the custodian does not automatically establish an agency relationship between the custodian and the government. That is, the custodian still has to represent the government in the custody transaction.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Written Evidence:</b> In many cases, an agency relationship between a government and a custodian is established in writing. Sometimes, this writing is a contract. In other cases, legal provisions serve as written evidence of the nature and scope of the custodian's responsibilities. For example, the statutes that require <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">deposits with financial institutions</b> to be collateralized often provide for the types of entities that may hold the collateral and the responsibilities the custodian has to protect the government's interests in the collateral.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The absence of written evidence does not mean the custodian cannot be the government's agent. However, the preparer would need to more closely evaluate the actual relationship between the government and the custodian to determine whether an agency relationship exists. That is, in the absence of writing, the matters of how the custodian's operations protect the government's interests and who selects the custodian become more important in establishing that the custodian is the government's agent.</div></body></html>
