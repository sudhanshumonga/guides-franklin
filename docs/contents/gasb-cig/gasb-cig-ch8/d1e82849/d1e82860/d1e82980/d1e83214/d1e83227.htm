As discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs45_par._7">paragraph 7</span> of Statement 45, postemployment healthcare benefits (such as medical, dental, vision, hearing, or other health-related benefits) are classified as OPEB for accounting and financial reporting purposes, whether the postemployment healthcare benefits are provided separately or are administered by a defined benefit pension plan. In the latter case, the employer should account for its expenses and liabilities related to two benefit plans—a pension plan (in conformity with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_statement_no__68_of_the_governmental_accounting_standards_board">Statement 68</span>, as amended, if the plan is administered through a trust that meets the criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs68__par__4">paragraph 4</span> of that Statement, or in conformity with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs73">Statement 73</span> if it does not meet those criteria) and an OPEB plan (in conformity with Statement 45, as amended). Similarly, from the plan administrator’s perspective, the activities associated with the two plans should be reported separately. If the pension plan is administered through a trust that meets the criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs67__par__3">paragraph 3</span> of Statement 67, it should be reported in conformity with Statement 67, as amended. If the pension plan is not administered through a trust that meets the criteria in paragraph 3 of Statement 67, assets held for purposes of providing pensions through the plan should be accounted for and reported in conformity with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs73_assets_accumulated1">paragraphs 115 and 116</span> of Statement 73. In all circumstances, the postemployment healthcare (OPEB) plan or assets held for purposes of providing OPEB should be reported in conformity with Statement 74.</div></body></html>
