The embedded derivative instrument should be measured as &quot;at-the-market&quot; at the inception of the hybrid instrument, discussed in greater detail in (a) and (b) below. Once the value of the embedded derivative instrument is determined, the value of the companion instrument is calculated as the difference between the total value of the hybrid instrument and the value of the embedded derivative instrument.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">a.For embedded non-option contracts, the at-the-market value should result in the embedded derivative instrument having a fair value of zero at inception. For example, a government receives an up-front payment when it enters into a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap that has an above-market fixed payment. The fixed rate on the swap is 5.00 percent, while the at-the-market fixed rate is 3.50 percent. The embedded derivative instrument is an at-the-market interest rate swap with a fixed payment of 3.50 percent. The remaining value of the hybrid instrument consists of the above-market terms (represented by the present value of the difference between 5.00 percent and 3.50 percent), which is allocated to the companion instrument (the borrowing). </div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">b.For embedded option contracts, the at-the-market value should be limited to the time value of the option at inception. That is, any intrinsic value should be considered part of the companion instrument. For example, a government writes a swaption, receiving an up-front payment to provide its counterparty with the option to put the city into a pay-fixed, receive-variable interest rate swap in two years. The fixed rate on the potential swap is an above-market rate of 5.50 percent. The at-the-market rate, 2 years forward, is 3.00 percent. The up-front payment is composed of the swaption’s intrinsic value (represented by the present value of the difference between 5.50 percent and 3.00 percent) and time value. Thus, the embedded derivative instrument—the option—is recorded at a value equal to the time value of the option only. The remaining value of the swaption is allocated to the companion instrument (the borrowing).</div></body></html>
