The only other display requirement is that the difference between the external pool’s assets, deferred outflows of resources, liabilities, and deferred inflows of resources be captioned “net position held in trust for pool participants.” Those requirements are easily accommodated in the pension trust fund display requirements set forth in Statement 67. To accommodate the requirements for additional details of investments and investment income, governments also should display that level of detail for all other fiduciary funds or clearly note on the face of the financial statement that summarized amounts exclude the more detailed pension data that is displayed.</div></body></html>
