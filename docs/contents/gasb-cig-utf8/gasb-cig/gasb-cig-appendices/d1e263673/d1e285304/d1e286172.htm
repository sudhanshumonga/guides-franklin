The foundation has a history of providing substantial financial support to several different entities each year including XYZ Art Museum, Anytown's public museum; community theatre groups; and other organizations with objectives consistent with the foundation's charter. Occasionally, donations received by the foundation are restricted for the benefit of specific organizations, but generally, restricted donations are distributed currently, rather than held. An accumulation of restricted resources would not be significant to any of the designated beneficiaries. The support given to XYZ Art Museum during the current year was significant to the museum. However, depending on the ongoing needs of other qualifying organizations and the foundation's resources available for distribution, this level of support to the museum has varied considerably over the years. </div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>The Carol Sauer Art Foundation is not required to be reported as a component unit of XYZ Art Museum because at least one of the three criteria is not satisfied. The "direct benefit" criterion is not met because the foundation supports several other organizations, and the resources it receives and holds are not entirely or almost entirely restricted for the benefit of XYZ Art Museum. Because the first criterion is not met, neither the "entitlement/ability to access" criterion nor the "significance" criterion needs to be considered. However, the “misleading to exclude" concept in paragraph 41 of Statement 14, as amended, should be considered.</div></body></html>
