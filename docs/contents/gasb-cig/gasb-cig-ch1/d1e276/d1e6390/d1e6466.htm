What constitutes <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">involuntary</b> participation?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Participation should be considered involuntary if external requirements mandate that participants place particular moneys with a particular external investment pool or with a particular investment pool sponsor. For example, if state law designates the county treasurer as the treasurer of all operating funds of school districts in the county, the participation of the school districts in the county pool should be considered involuntary. This is the case even though the treasurer may offer the school districts a choice of one of three pools; their participation with the pool sponsor is required by state law. If, instead, a school district invests its operating funds with the county treasurer based on the requirements of the school district&#39;s governing board or a bond indenture developed by that board, that participation is not involuntary because it is not externally imposed.</div></body></html>
