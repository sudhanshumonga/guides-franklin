The agreement, which requires the district to display advertising materials as and when requested by the agency, is for five years and provides for semi-annual payments to the district. The district has the opportunity to receive a lump-sum payment this year from an outside party for the rights to the future cash flows (the semi-annual payments). Should that transaction be reported as a sale or a collateralized borrowing? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The transaction should be reported by the district as a borrowing because it maintains an active involvement in the generation of the advertising revenues. The fundamental activity that generates the revenue is the provision of advertising space on buses, shelters, and facilities, and an obligation to display specific advertisements in those spaces as and when required by the agreement. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs48_par_9">Paragraph 9</span> of Statement 48 states that active involvement generally requires a substantive action or performance. Therefore, because the district&#39;s involvement constitutes performance, the cash flows from those future revenues cannot be &quot;sold.&quot; The lump sum received by the district should be reported as a liability.</div></body></html>
