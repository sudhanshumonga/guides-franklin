The board of the PTO is not appointed by the school district. These resources are required to be used exclusively for the benefit of the school district. The PTO solicits funds year-round and sponsors an annual drive to perpetuate and secure the future contributions to the school district. The funds raised, or the income earned thereon, are contributed to the school district as determined by the board of the PTO, but generally the PTO retains only enough resources to cover its fund-raising and other operational expenses. The PTO is a &quot;financially interrelated&quot; organization based on the guidance of <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">FASB Accounting Standards Codification</b> <b class="superscript ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="superscript">®</b> Topic 958-20, Not-for-Profit Entities, Financially Interrelated Entities. The funds raised and given to the school district in the current year are significant to the school district.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>The PTO is a component unit of the school district and should be discretely presented in the district&#39;s reporting entity financial statements. The PTO is a legally separate, tax-exempt entity whose resources are entirely for the direct benefit of the school district. Because the PTO is a &quot;financially interrelated&quot; organization, the &quot;entitlement/ability to access&quot; criterion is satisfied; furthermore, the &quot;significance&quot; criterion is met because, even though the resources held by the PTO are negligible, the resources raised and distributed annually are significant to the district. </div></body></html>
