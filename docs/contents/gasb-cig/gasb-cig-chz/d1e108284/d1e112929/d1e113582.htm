Often, scheduled payments to liquidate or reduce those contractual obligations are included in a government&#39;s budget and are expected to be paid from current-period revenues. Fund balance should be classified as committed only if the government commits existing resources, rather than future revenues, to satisfy the contractual obligation (to the extent that the obligation is not recognized as a fund liability). </div></body></html>
