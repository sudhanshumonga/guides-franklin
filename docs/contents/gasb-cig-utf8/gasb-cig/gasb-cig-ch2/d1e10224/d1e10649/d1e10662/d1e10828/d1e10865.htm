The determination of whether a pool is being used as a demand deposit account should be made by each participant, independently of how other participants use the pool. If the pool is managed in such a way as to allow the governmental enterprise making the evaluation to deposit and withdraw funds as if it were a demand deposit account, that governmental enterprise's equity in the pool could be considered cash.</div></body></html>
