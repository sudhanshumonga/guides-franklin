Classification of a transaction for operating statement purposes should not dictate its classification in the statement of cash flows. As discussed in Question 2.18.1, the transaction should be evaluated first according to the definitions of the capital and related financing, noncapital financing, and investing activities categories.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs9_par._16">Paragraph 16</span> of Statement 9 states that &quot;cash flows from operating activities generally are the cash effects of transactions and other events that enter into the determination of operating income.&quot; It was believed that most nonoperating income items would be classified in other than the operating activities category. The reconciliation of operating income to cash flows from operating activities would have fewer reconciling items if the operating activities category were highly correlated to operating income. However, paragraph 16 <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">definitively</b> states that the operating activities category includes &quot;all transactions and other events that are not defined as capital and related financing, noncapital financing, or investing activities.&quot; Therefore, operating income should not be considered a criterion for classifying cash flows. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If a transaction is included in operating income and its resulting cash flow meets the definition of a category other than operating activities, the item should be presented as a reconciling item in the reconciliation of operating income to net cash flow from operating activities. For example, if a finance authority reports interest income as a component of operating income, the cash received from interest income should be presented in the investing activities category. The reconciliation of operating income to net cash flow from operating activities should begin with reported operating income, and the interest income amount should be deducted as a reconciling adjustment to operating income, similar to depreciation.
