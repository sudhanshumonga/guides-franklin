If the restrictions are short-lived—for example, cash that is held in a bond and interest reserve account that is required to be used to pay current maturities—the cash could be reported with unrestricted cash. On the other hand, if the conditions underlying the restrictions are such that they will not be met in the short or medium term, restricted assets would be reported lower (as less liquid) in the statement of net position. Permanently restricted resources, for example, are essentially as illiquid as capital assets. Term restrictions may indicate that the assets should be reported at approximately the same liquidity level as long-term receivables, depending on the length of the restrictions.
