What conditions have to be evaluated to properly determine whether the investment securities are held in the government's name?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—This is a fairly common situation because many financial institutions and broker-dealers use "correspondents" for custody of securities, both those they own and those they hold for clients. To simplify the following discussion, the named custodian is referred to as "Custodian A" and the correspondent is "Custodian Z."</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">For Custodian A to be found to be holding the government's investment securities in the name of the government, Custodian Z's records and procedures should recognize that the investment securities belong to Custodian A's clients. Therefore, Custodian Z should hold the investment securities in the name of Custodian A for the benefit of Custodian A's clients. For this to be true, two conditions should exist. First, Custodian Z should hold the investment securities in bearer form, in street or nominee name, or in a customer account in a book entry system. Second, Custodian Z's records should show that the investment securities are owned by Custodian A's clients. That is, Custodian A should be holding the investment securities in a street name, nominee name, or customer account with Custodian Z. Custodian Z does not need to know which investment securities are owned by which of Custodian A's individual clients.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If these two conditions <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">do not</b> exist, Custodian A cannot be found to be holding the investment securities in the name of the government. This is because either (a) Custodian Z is not holding in a custodial position for Custodian A or (b) Custodian Z believes the investment securities are owned by Custodian A. In either case, the government's rights to the investment securities are not clear—and the government should disclose the investment securities as being exposed to custodial credit risk.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">However, if Custodian Z knows and acknowledges that specific investment securities are owned by or pledged to the government, the investment securities would not be exposed to custodial credit risk. However, in the absence of special arrangements, it is unlikely that a correspondent will know and acknowledge that specific investment securities are owned by or pledged to the government.</div></body></html>
