The contract contains an assignment clause that one party may assign its rights or obligations to a third party, provided the counterparty first agrees. Does this assignment clause preclude the existence of a market mechanism that facilitates net settlement described in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.13">paragraph 13b</span> of Statement 53?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The existence of an assignment clause does not, in and of itself, preclude the contract from possessing the net settlement characteristic described in paragraph 13b as a market mechanism. Once the determination is made that a market mechanism exists, then the substance of the assignment clause should be evaluated. The requirement to obtain permission from the counterparty should not be viewed as a mere formality, because the counterparty has the right to deny permission. The assignment, for example, may potentially increase the counterparty’s exposure to credit or performance risk, causing it to deny the assignment. In its assessment of the assignment clause, the government should determine the probability that the counterparty will deny permission for assignment. If this probability is remote, the existence of the clause should not preclude the contract from having a market mechanism as described in paragraph 13b.</div></body></html>
