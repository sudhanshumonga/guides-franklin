A money-weighted rate of return considers the changing amounts actually invested during a period and weights the amount of pension plan investments by the proportion of time they are available to earn a return during that period. The rate of return is then calculated by solving, through an iterative process, for the rate that equates (1) the sum of the weighted external cash flows into and out of pension plan investments to (2) the ending value of pension plan investments. </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">In this illustration, the value of pension plan investments at the beginning of the fiscal year is $18,907,442, and the value of pension plan investments at the end of the fiscal year is $20,047,797. Inputs (external cash flows) are determined on a monthly basis and are assumed to occur at the end of each month. External cash inflows are netted with external cash outflows, resulting in a net external cash outflow in each month of this illustration.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The following details the two broad steps of the calculation of the money-weighted rate of return for the period from July 1–June 30.</div><div class="ps_tertiary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_tertiary_heading">Step 1:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_tertiary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_tertiary_heading">Step 2:</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Solve for rmw such that the ending value of pension plan investments, which is $20,047,797, equals the sum of amounts in column (d).
