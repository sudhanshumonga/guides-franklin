The minimum level of detail required is listed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs9_par._31">paragraph 31</span> of Statement 9, as amended, and is discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_content_and_format_issues_rec1">Questions 2.29.1 and 2.29.2</span>. For example, cash receipts from customers should be presented separately from other operating cash receipts, and cash payments to suppliers should be presented separately from other operating cash payments. Because borrowers in a qualifying loan program are neither suppliers nor customers (they are direct beneficiaries of the program), it would be appropriate to separately identify cash disbursements and collections of loans. It would also be useful to separate the collection of principal from interest received. The principal and interest components of normal loan collections are separately identified in the investing activities category.
