For example, county commissioners are elected to serve on the county board of commissioners and, as a result of that election, also serve as the county parks and recreation board. Would both governing boards be considered separately elected?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. There would be no difference between a board that is serving in a dual capacity based on a single election and a board consisting of primary government officials serving &quot;ex officio,&quot; or as required by law. In this example, only the county board of commissioners would be considered separately elected.</div><div class="ps_summbox p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_summbox"> <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Note: </b>References to &quot;primary government,&quot; other than in the preceding questions pertaining to definitions, are equally applicable to other stand-alone governments and component units in their separately issued financial statements.</div></body></html>
