Enrollment is initially projected at 1,000 students and is expected to grow to 2,500 students in 5 to 7 years. The planning, development, and construction occur over a four-year period. The school opens with only a 600-student enrollment and 5 years later reaches an enrollment of only 800 students. The less-than-expected enrollment resulted from:</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">a.Development in the area around the school including more commercial development and less residential development than originally projected</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">b.Expansion of private/nonpublic education institutions as a result of the recent availability of public education vouchers for private/nonpublic education institutions.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Should the school be evaluated for impairment? Should the situation be considered a temporary impairment?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>Lower than projected enrollment at a new school does not indicate impairment. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs42_par._10">Paragraph 10</span> of Statement 42 states that a change in demand for the services of a capital asset is not considered an indicator of impairment. Change in demand may be a change from prior levels of demand or projected levels of demand for a service, as in this school example. Because the situation does not present an indicator of impairment and is therefore not an impairment, further assessment as to whether this situation would be considered a temporary impairment is not necessary. Furthermore, if the facts of the situation were different and included an indicator of impairment such as management closing a wing of the school as in Question Z.42.9, and if the subsequent test of impairment revealed the asset was impaired, the impairment would not be considered a temporary impairment because no evidence regarding reversal of the present situation was available.</div></body></html>
