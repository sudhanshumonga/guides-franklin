In order to hedge against interest rate risk prior to issuance, the government enters into a forward-starting (in 6 months), 10-year interest rate swap. The bond will carry a semiannual coupon. Likewise, the swap’s payments will be made semiannually. The purpose of the swap is to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the interest payments of the to-be-issued bond. Six months after the inception of the hedge, the government issues the bond. Due to market conditions, however, the government issues a 6-year bond instead of the 10-year bond originally planned. How does the government’s decision to issue a 6-year bond affect the hedging relationship and the related deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflows of resources of the 10-year interest rate swap?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—A cash flow hedge of future interest payments is a hedge of a series of expected transactions. The likelihood of whether and when each expected transaction in the series will occur should be determined. Because the government issued a 6-year bond, instead of a 10-year bond, the new bond represents 12 expected coupon payments and not the 20 interest payments that were originally expected. Therefore, the first 12 swap payments pertain to the hedged item (the 12 expected interest payments) and should be reported as a deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources and recognized in a systematic and rational manner over the life of the 6-year bond (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.25">paragraph 25a(2)</span> of Statement 53, as amended). The remaining eight swap payments, however, do not pertain to the six-year bond. The amount in the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources account attributable to those eight payments should be immediately recognized on the resource flows statement within the investment revenue classification (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.23">paragraph 23</span>, as amended).</div></body></html>
