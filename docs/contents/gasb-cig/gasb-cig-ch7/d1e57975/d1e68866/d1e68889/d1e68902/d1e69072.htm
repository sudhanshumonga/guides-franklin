Should the major/nonmajor fund presentation from the prior year be restated so that the nonmajor fund ending fund balances reported in the prior year agree with the beginning fund balances presented for the current year? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The statements for the prior year should present the major/nonmajor fund detail as it resulted from the application of the major fund criteria at that time. Even though the beginning fund balances for the nonmajor funds will not agree with the ending balances presented in the prior year, the fund balances for the total governmental funds are not affected by the change in major funds. The government should consider disclosing an explanation of the difference in the notes.</div></body></html>
