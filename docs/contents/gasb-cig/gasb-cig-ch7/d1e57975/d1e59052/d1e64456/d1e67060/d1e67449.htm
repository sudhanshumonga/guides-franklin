If the purchase and sale of the permits are within the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">same</b> function, the expenses and revenues should be eliminated to remove the grossing up of both direct expenses and program revenues within that category. However, as discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._315">paragraph 315</span> of the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 34, as a practical matter, eliminations of this kind are not necessary unless the effect on direct expenses or program revenues is material.
