The operating revenues of the fund are pledged as security for the bonds, but in order to enhance the marketability of and perhaps lower the interest rates on the bonds, the city also secondarily backs the bonds with its full faith and credit. The possibility that the city would have to use its general revenues to service the debt is remote. Is the city required to use an enterprise fund for the water and sewer operations, based on <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._67">paragraph 67a</span> of Statement 34? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The government <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">may</b> use an enterprise fund, but is not <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">required</b> to do so. Paragraph 67a requires use of an enterprise fund when the debt is secured <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">solely</b> by the operation&#39;s revenues.
