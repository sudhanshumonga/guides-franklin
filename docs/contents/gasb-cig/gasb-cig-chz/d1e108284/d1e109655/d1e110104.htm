For example, if the estimated restoration cost is significantly higher than the actual restoration cost incurred in a subsequent year, should the amount of impairment loss be recalculated and adjusted? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Impairment loss amounts should not be revised in subsequent years due to price level changes. The restoration cost method uses an estimate of both the restoration cost and the replacement cost (or a cost index). Price level changes would affect both estimates and, as such, would not affect the resulting ratio, which is the basis for the calculation of the impairment loss.</div></body></html>
