Discretely presented component units may be aggregated into a single-column presentation on the face of the financial statements; however, details of major component units included in this aggregation should be presented either in combining statements or in notes to the financial statements. Disclosure (and the combining statement approach) supplements, but does not replace, the display of component unit information on the face of the financial statements. (See Question 4.28.22 relating to the condensed financial statements required in combining statements or notes to the financial statements.)</div></body></html>
