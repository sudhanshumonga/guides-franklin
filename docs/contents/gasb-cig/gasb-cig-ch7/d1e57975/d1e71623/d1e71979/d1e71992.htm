There are outstanding revenue bonds that pertain to the water reservoir and distribution lines. The sewer operation has no long-term debt attributable to it. Although both operations are accounted for in a single fund, the revenue bond indenture requires the city to maintain separate asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts for the water operations. What are the segment reporting requirements for the Water and Sewer Fund? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The disclosures set forth in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#segment_information__rec1">paragraph 122</span> of Statement 34, as amended, are required for the water operation, but not for the sewer operation. The primary motive in requiring the segment disclosures was to ensure the availability of information about activities financed by revenue-backed debt, even if the activity was not reported in a separate fund. Therefore, even though the sewer operation is an identifiable activity with its own asset, liability, revenue, expense, gain, and loss accounts, the segment disclosures in paragraph 122, as amended, are not required because of the absence of revenue-backed debt.
