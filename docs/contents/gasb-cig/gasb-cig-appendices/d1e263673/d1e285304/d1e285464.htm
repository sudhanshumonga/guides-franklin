The utility is governed by a seven-member board of trustees, the members of which are appointed by the governor to fixed terms. The board members can be removed only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or misconduct in office; and after due process, including formal charges and a public hearing.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The utility determines its own budget and sets its own rates. It also issues debt in its own name. The state is not obligated in any manner for the debt of the utility. The state also has no obligation to provide financial support to the utility and it does not have access to the utility&#39;s resources. The enabling legislation requires that certain contracts for power sales be approved by the governor. However, these contracts represent only a small fraction of the utility&#39;s outstanding contracts and the governor&#39;s approval authority is limited by financing provisions within the enabling legislation and the utility&#39;s bond covenants.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The utility is not a component unit of the state; however, because the governor appoints the board of the utility, the state would report the utility as a related organization of the state. Even though the state does appoint the members of the governing board, the state does not have the ability to impose its will on the utility. The ability of the state to remove the board members is restricted by the requirement for formal charges and a public hearing, and the authority of the governor to approve contracts of the utility is not substantive because of the restrictions placed on that authority. There is no financial benefit or burden relationship between the two organizations.</div></body></html>
