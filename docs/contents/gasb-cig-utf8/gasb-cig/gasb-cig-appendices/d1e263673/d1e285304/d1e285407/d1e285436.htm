However, the amount of the payment imposed is not required to be directly related to the costs of providing specific services. The city has not assessed a payment on the authority.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The authority would be a component unit of the city and should be discretely presented. The financial benefit criteria require only that a primary government be legally entitled to, or otherwise have access to, the resources of the organization to create a financial benefit. The city's ability to assess payments in lieu of taxes on the authority gives the city access to the authority's resources. It does not matter whether or not the city has exercised this ability. This financial benefit, coupled with the city's appointment of a voting majority of the authority's board, constitutes financial accountability.</div></body></html>
