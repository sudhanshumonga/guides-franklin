The interest rate swap has an embedded call option that allows the agency to modify the notional amount of the swap. The purpose of the option is to allow, but not require, the agency to adjust the notional amount of the swap so that the swap’s notional amount is consistent with the principal amount of the hedged debt. When the hedging relationship is established, the option is at the market. That is, the option is structured such that the notional amount of the option is consistent with expected prepayment speeds of the hedged debt. As time elapses, however, actual prepayments vary. If the agency exercises the option to adjust the notional amount of the hedging interest rate swaps, are the critical terms of the hedge changed such that the hedge established at inception has been terminated?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The existence of the option was part of the fixed payment rate negotiated by the agency when the interest rate swap was entered into and the hedge was established. Indeed, the agency’s option mirrors the put option that mortgagees have. Given the exercise strike rates and resultant revised notional amounts, the agency should consider whether the modified interest rate swap puts the agency into an over or under hedged position. That issue is addressed in Question 10.16.5.</div></body></html>
