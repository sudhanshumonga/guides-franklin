The payment will be made on the date the employee ceases service, regardless of when the employee leaves service during the period from February 1 to October 31, 20X1. At the end of the state’s fiscal year (June 30, 20X1), assuming a discount rate of 3.5 percent and no departures prior to that date, the present value of this benefit is calculated to be $745,005.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub_para_bullet_list p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub_para_bullet_list">b.Each terminated employee that renders service until October 31, 20X1, will receive an additional one-time cash payment of $10,000. An employee that leaves voluntarily before October 31 will not be eligible to receive any portion of the additional $10,000 benefit. The state estimates that 70 employees will collect the additional payment. At the end of the state’s fiscal year (June 30, 20X1), assuming no change in the estimated number of employees who will receive the payout, the present value of the benefit is calculated to be $691,810.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Following is a summary of what the state should report in its financial statements for the period ended June 30, 20X1, with regard to termination benefits.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The termination benefits described consist of two components—one with a future service requirement and one without. In accordance with paragraph 13 of Statement 47, the state should first recognize a liability and expense for the portion of the involuntary termination benefit that does not have a future service requirement when the plan is communicated to employees (February 1, 20X1). In addition, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph 15 of Statement 47, the state should recognize a liability and expense for the portion of the involuntary termination benefit that has a future service requirement ratably over the period from February 1, 20X1 (when the plan is communicated to the employees) to July 31, 20X1 (the end of the required future service period). Statement 47 also requires remeasurement of both portions of the liability at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, the state would report a termination benefits liability and expense for the period ended June 30, 20X1, in the amount of $1,129,344 for (a) the entire present value of benefits for which future service is not required ($745,005) and (b) five-ninths of the total present value of termination benefit payments that are conditioned on a future service requirement and that are expected to be paid at the end of the required service period ($691,810 × 5/9 = $384,339). </div></body></html>
