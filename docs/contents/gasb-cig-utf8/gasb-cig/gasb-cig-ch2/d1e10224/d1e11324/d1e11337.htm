Therefore, the provision allowing a governmental enterprise to report certain cash flows net is an exception that should be used only after careful consideration. A governmental enterprise that qualifies for netting in one year should not presume to qualify permanently because it is possible to meet the criteria in one reporting period but not in another. Paragraph 14 lists two criteria that should be met in order for a governmental enterprise to qualify for net reporting of investments, and both should be evaluated throughout the year: "(a) during the period, substantially all of the governmental enterprise's assets were highly liquid investments (for example, marketable securities and other assets for which a market is readily available) and (b) the governmental enterprise had little or no debt, based on average debt outstanding during the period, in relation to average total assets." The basic characteristics of a governmental enterprise that qualifies for this netting provision should be called into question if they are subject to change. Essentially, the exception was designed to facilitate the cash flow reporting of governmental enterprises engaged solely in managing a highly liquid investment portfolio. If high liquidity varied from year to year, the governmental enterprise would not meet the spirit of the exception in any year.</div></body></html>
