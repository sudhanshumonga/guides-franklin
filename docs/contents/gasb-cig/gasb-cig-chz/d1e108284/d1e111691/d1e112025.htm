The water rights are being used in those operations and are not themselves directly generating the income or profit. Any income or profit associated with the use of the water rights is an indirect result of ownership of the rights. Therefore, the water rights would be an intangible asset subject to the provisions of Statement 51. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">In contrast, if the utility fund acquired the water rights with the intention of generating income through trading those rights, instead of intending to use them in its operations, the water rights would be excluded from the scope of Statement 51 under paragraph 3a. </div></body></html>
