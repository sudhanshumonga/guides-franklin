The total direct rate is the weighted average of all individual direct rates applied by a government to a particular revenue base.</div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Example A</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">A government has three property tax levies, all of which apply a single rate to all property—$1.00, $0.50, and $0.25 per $1,000 of assessed value. The calculation of the total direct rate would be a simple summation of the individual direct rates as follows:</div><div class="ps_center_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_center_1">$1.00 + $0.50 + $0.25 = $1.75</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The direct rate for this government is $1.75.</div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Example B</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">A government sets differential rates for different types of property. One- and two-family homes are taxed at a rate of $1.00 per $1,000 of assessed value. residential property other than one- and two-family homes is taxed at a rate of $1.50 per $1,000 of assessed value. Real property other than residential property is taxed at a rate of $2.00 per $1,000 of assessed value. Becasue the government sets differential rates for different types of property, it will need to employ a formula for calculating a weighted average that multiplies each rate by the proportion of the revenue base to which it applies.</div><div class="ps_center_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_center_1">[rate x (amount of revenue base to which the rate applies + total taxable revenue base)]</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The products from each calculation are summed to produce the total direct rate.</div><div class="ps_sources_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sources_1"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The direct rate for this government is $1.58.</div></body></html>
