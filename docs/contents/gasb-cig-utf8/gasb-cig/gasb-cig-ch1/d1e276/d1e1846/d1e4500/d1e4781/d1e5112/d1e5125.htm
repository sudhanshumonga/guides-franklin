The custodian holds the securities underlying the agreement in the names of both repurchase agreement parties (the buyer-lender as pledgee and the seller-borrower as owner).</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the government is a direct party to the tri-party agreement and the custodian is the trust department of a financial institution that is the seller-borrower or an affiliate of the seller-borrower of the repurchase agreement, the government's investment would not be exposed to custodial credit risk, provided that the fair value of the underlying securities meets or exceeds the reported amount of the repurchase agreement. If the custodian is an affiliate of a financial institution that is the seller-borrower of the repurchase agreement, the government's investment would be exposed to custodial credit risk.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Sometimes governments are not direct parties to a tri-party agreement. Instead, they purchase the investment through or from a financial institution or broker-dealer that is the buyer-lender in the tri-party agreement. Sometimes the government's investment is in an individual repurchase agreement. Other times, the government participates in a "repurchase agreement pool," purchasing only a portion of a repurchase agreement in which the financial institution or broker-dealer is the buyer-lender. The financial institution or broker-dealer that purchased the investment for or sold it to the government is the counterparty, and the securities are being held by the counterparty's agent in the counterparty's name. In these cases the government would report these investments as subject to custodial credit risk disclosures.</div></body></html>
