All general obligation bonds should be included in the schedule of general bonded debt, regardless of the purpose for which they are used, the fund in which they are reported, or the revenues being used to repay them, because general obligation debt communicates an ultimate recourse to the general resources of a government. General bonded debt also should include other bonded debt that is (or ultimately could be) payable with general governmental resources. Typically, general bonded debt, including general obligation bonds, is reported with the governmental activities debt in the schedule of ratios of outstanding debt; in this case, however, the bonds should be reported with the business-type activities debt.</div></body></html>
