The utility based the quantity of its expected purchases of natural gas on historical seasonal consumption and average temperatures. The weather is unseasonably warm, and the demand for natural gas does not meet the utility’s projections. Because the volume of natural gas purchased is less than what was expected, what should be the accounting treatment of the hedging relationship and the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources amount?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The utility should base its treatment of the hedging relationship and deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources amount upon its best estimate of the probable terms of the expected transaction and the hedging derivative instrument. If the utility allows the futures contracts to mature and the expected transaction has not occurred by the maturity date, then a termination event has occurred and the amount of the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources attributable to the unpurchased natural gas should be reported in the resource flows statement within the investment revenue classification (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.23">paragraph 23</span> of Statement 53, as amended).</div></body></html>
