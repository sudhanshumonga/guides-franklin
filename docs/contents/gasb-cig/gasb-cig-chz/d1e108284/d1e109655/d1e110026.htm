The regulation does not prohibit continued operation of the facilities; however, the additional costs of low-sulfur coal or of the installation of scrubbers may make it no longer economically feasible to continue to operate a facility. Is adoption of this regulation an indicator of impairment for coal-fired generating facilities? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>No. Adoption of the regulation is not an indicator of impairment for coal-fired generating facilities, because the regulation does not directly reduce the service utility of these facilities. However, if management decides to close a facility to avoid the costs of complying with the regulation, the decision to close the facility would be an indicator of impairment and would precipitate an impairment evaluation.</div></body></html>
