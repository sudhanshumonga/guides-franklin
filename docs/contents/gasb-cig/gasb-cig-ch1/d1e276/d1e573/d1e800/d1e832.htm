A government should consider the risks of its portfolios as risks of the primary government when determining the appropriate level-of-detail disclosures. Disclosures for the primary government may be aggregated by portfolio. For example, a government holding separate portfolios for governmental and business-type activities, individual major funds, nonmajor funds in the aggregate, or fiduciary fund types should disclose such risks of those portfolios when the risk exposures are significantly greater than the deposit and investment risks of the primary government.</div></body></html>
