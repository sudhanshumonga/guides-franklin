If a water utility has one very large customer that, for example, accounts for half of its water usage, a per capita ratio using number of customers might be distorted.

This could be accomplished by comparing the number of customers (minus the large customer) with a portion of the outstanding debt that is proportionate to the share of total revenue, using the following formula:</div><div class="ps_center_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_center_1">[(water charge revenue from other customers ÷ total water charge revenue)× outstanding debt] ÷ number of other customers</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If this approach is used, the government would need to properly footnote the exclusion of the large customer from the calculation and describe its method of calculation.</div></body></html>
