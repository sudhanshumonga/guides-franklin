As described in paragraph 43 of Statement 14, all component units are required to apply the definition and display provisions of Statement 14, as amended, before they are combined with the primary government. In the reporting entity&#39;s statement of net position, a discretely presented component unit&#39;s financial data may be presented in a separate discrete column or combined with the financial data of other discretely presented component units as described in paragraph 44, as amended. Similarly, in the reporting entity&#39;s statement of activities, a nongovernmental component unit&#39;s financial data may be presented on a separate line or combined with the financial data of other component units. The financial data of a nongovernmental component unit would be arrayed based on the same display considerations as those discussed for component units engaged only in business-type activities in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_157">Question 7.26.6</span>. If the reporting entity&#39;s financial statements do not include a statement of activities, the nongovernmental component unit&#39;s financial statement data should be reconfigured into a display that is compatible with the reporting entity&#39;s change statement format and be presented in a discrete column to the right of the financial statement data of the primary government. However, if it is impractical to reformat the nongovernmental component unit&#39;s change statement data, they need not be reported on the same page as that of the primary government, but may be reported on a separate following page. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_4.33.3">Questions 4.33.3 and 4.33.4</span> about including financial data of nongovernmental component units.)</div></body></html>
