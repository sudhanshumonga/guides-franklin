The intention of Statement 10 is to preclude the use of fiduciary funds, because it is believed that there is no fiduciary or trust relationship in risk financing activities. As a result, a fund that is used to provide risk management—and is used for no other function—should be an internal service fund, regardless of the number of separate funds performing that function (for example, one fund for workers&#39; compensation and another for general liability). Alternatively, if separate internal service funds have not been established, a governmental fund should be used to report all of these activities.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Statement 10, as amended, does not require that all of a government&#39;s risk financing be classified in a single fund type. Therefore, a governmental entity can account for one form of risk financing in a governemental fund and another form in an internal service fund.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Furthermore, risk financing can still be accounted for in an enterprise fund or a special revenue fund for risk within the fund. However, risk financing cannot be provided to other funds of the entity without reporting the risk financing activity as an internal service fund or incorporating it into a governmental fund.</div></body></html>
