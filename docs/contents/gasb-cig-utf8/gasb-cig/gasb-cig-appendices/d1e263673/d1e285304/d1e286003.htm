The governing board of the authority is appointed by the governor. The authority determines its own budget, holds title to property in its own name, and controls its own day-to-day operations. Mortgage loans are made subject to guidelines included in the authority's enabling legislation. The authority is authorized to issue debt, subject to a statutory limitation. All bonds issued to provide mortgage loans are secured by first mortgages on the related developments and are payable from the proceeds of mortgage repayments. In the event that the authority determines that funds will not be sufficient for the payment of the principal and interest on its bonds during the next succeeding state fiscal year, the chairman of the authority certifies to the governor the amount required to pay such principal and interest. The governor is obligated to include these amounts in the state budget. However, the legislature has no obligation to appropriate funds for the authority.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The financing authority should be reported as a discretely presented component unit of the state.

This potential obligation imposes a financial burden on the state that, together with the appointment of the voting majority of the authority’s board, which would create financial accountability.</div></body></html>
