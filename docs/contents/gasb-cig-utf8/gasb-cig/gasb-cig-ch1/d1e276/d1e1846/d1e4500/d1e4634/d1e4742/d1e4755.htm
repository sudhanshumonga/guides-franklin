It is reasonable, however, that to be considered adequate, the scope of coverage provided by a commercial insurance company would have to be substantially the same as the protection provided by the SIPC. For the scope of coverage to be considered substantially the same, the same risks would have to be covered. That is, the insurance would have to cover all types of broker-dealer failures, not only certain types of losses (for example, only losses from theft). Preparers also may need to evaluate whether other conditions exist that may make private-sector insurance dissimilar to SIPC protection and thus subject the investment securities to custodial credit risk disclosures.</div></body></html>
