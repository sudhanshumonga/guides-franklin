Therefore, each fund with a position in the internal investment pool should report its position as, for example, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">equity in cash management pool, equity in internal investment pool, cash and cash equivalents, </b>or<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> investments</b>. Reporting the entire position of the pool in the general fund, with corresponding interfund receivables and payables for the other funds&#39; equity positions, misrepresents the nature of the positions. Likewise, an agency fund should not report internally pooled investments, with payables to participating funds.</div></body></html>
