Securities underlying repurchase agreements often take the form of U.S. Treasuries or obligations explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, which are not considered to have credit risk. Bankers&#39; acceptances constitute an irrevocable primary obligation of the accepting bank, a contingent obligation of the drawer, and an obligation of any other institution that has endorsed the acceptance. However, because bankers&#39; acceptances are not obligations of the U.S. government, nor are they explicitly guaranteed by the U.S. government, they are not afforded the credit risk exemption provided in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#disclosures_for_specific_risks_rec1">paragraph 7</span> of Statement 40, as amended, and their credit risk should be disclosed. (See also <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_107">Question 1.43.3</span>, which addresses custodial credit risk for investments in repurchase agreements.)</div></body></html>
