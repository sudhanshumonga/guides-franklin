For example, if a government accounts for its central supplies activity in the general fund and charges other funds for supplies used plus an additional amount to cover &quot;overhead&quot; costs—such as a percentage of certain office employees&#39; salaries and related office expenses—it would not be required to eliminate the overhead markup. However, the summary of significant accounting policies should disclose that &quot;direct expenses&quot; includes that element.</div></body></html>
