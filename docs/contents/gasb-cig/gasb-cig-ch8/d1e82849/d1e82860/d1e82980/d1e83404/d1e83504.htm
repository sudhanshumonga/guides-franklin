(For example, the payments may be defined as a percentage of final salary.) For accounting purposes, what type of benefit is this (for example, is it OPEB, a pension, or a termination benefit), and what is the criterion or process for classification? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The first determination that should be made is <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">for what purpose</b> the benefit is given. That is, are the cash payments compensation for an employee&#39;s services, or are they offered as an early termination incentive? If the benefit is part of the employment contract and is not conditioned on early termination of employment, those factors would strongly indicate that the benefit is part of an employee&#39;s total compensation for services; thus, it is a postemployment benefit. The second determination that should be made is <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">whether the cash payments are pensions or OPEB</b> (postemployment benefit other than a pension benefit) for accounting purposes. The benefit, however labeled, is provided in the form of cash payments with no limitation as to their use, fitting the term <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">retirement income.</b> (A limitation with regard to the use of the cash payments might be evidenced by, for example, the employer reimbursing retirees for documented healthcare payments—a condition that does not exist in this question.) Therefore, based on the definitions of <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">pension benefits </b>(in Statement 45, as amended), <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">pensions</b> (in Statements <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_statement_no__68_of_the_governmental_accounting_standards_board">68</span> and <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs73">73</span>), and <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">other postemployment benefits </b> (in Statement 45, as amended, and Statements 68 and 73), the benefit in this question is a pension that should be accounted for in accordance with the requirements of Statement 68, as amended, or Statement 73, as applicable.</div></body></html>
