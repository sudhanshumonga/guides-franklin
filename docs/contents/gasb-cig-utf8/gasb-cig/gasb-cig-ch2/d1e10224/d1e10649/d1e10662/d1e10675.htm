The definition of cash equivalents in Statement 9, paragraph 9, first refers to short-term, highly liquid investments that are (a) both readily convertible to known amounts of cash and (b) so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. Although this definition appears to be somewhat broad, the reference to "three months or less" provides more specific guidance.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Because the definition of cash equivalents is a vital part of a cash flow presentation, a uniform definition should be used by all governmental enterprises. Therefore, generally only investments with original maturities of three months or less meet the definition of cash equivalents. </div></body></html>
