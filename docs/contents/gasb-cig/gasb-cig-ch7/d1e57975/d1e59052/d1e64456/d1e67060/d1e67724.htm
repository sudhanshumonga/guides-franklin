Thus, the excess amounts charged to the funds to provide for future catastrophe losses would be eliminated in the look-back adjustment, so that the expenses reported by the functions or programs in the statement of activities are in accordance with the expense recognition requirements of paragraphs <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#liability_and_expenditure_expense_recognition_and_measurement_rec1">53–56</span> of Statement 10, as amended, and <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#liability_and_expenditure_expense_recognition_and_measurement_1_rec1">paragraph 9</span> of Statement 30. The additional charge to the funds to provide for future catastrophe losses does not constitute an <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">expense</b> in the statement of activities, but rather is a transfer device for accumulating resources for a specified purpose. The accumulated resources in the internal service fund should be disclosed in the notes as intended for future catastrophes, in accordance with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs10_par._67">paragraph 67</span> of Statement 10, as amended.</div></body></html>
