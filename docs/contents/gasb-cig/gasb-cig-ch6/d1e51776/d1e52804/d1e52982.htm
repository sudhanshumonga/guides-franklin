For example, consider a bond selling at 102 that is purchased between its semiannual interest payment dates. The purchaser would be expected to pay the counterparty 102, plus the amount of accrued interest the counterparty is entitled to. This purchased interest will be received by the purchaser of the bond on the next interest payment date.</div></body></html>
