A governmental or proprietary fund may be used to account for the entire amount (a, b, and c), with liabilities for the amounts that will be paid to claimants or other governments. Alternatively, a governmental or proprietary fund may be used to account for only the amount that will eventually revert to the government, with the amounts held for claimants accounted for in a private-purpose trust fund and amounts held for other governments in an agency fund.</div></body></html>
