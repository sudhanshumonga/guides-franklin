The government does not provide postemployment healthcare benefits to employees that terminate at the full retirement age of 65 or thereafter. Should this benefit be accounted for as OPEB? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The benefit described is in the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">form</b> of healthcare benefits to be given after employment, which seems to suggest that it <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">might</b> be OPEB. However, in determining how to classify and account for benefits given in the form of healthcare, it also is necessary to consider the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">purpose</b> for which they are given. The application of professional judgment is required to distinguish whether postemployment healthcare benefits are given by an employer (a) as compensation for employee services—in which case they should be accounted for as OPEB in conformity with Statement 45—or (b) as an inducement to employees to hasten the termination of their services—in which case they should be accounted for as a termination benefit. In the situation described, the fact that the healthcare benefits are conditioned on an employee&#39;s acceptance of the employer&#39;s early termination offer and are provided as an incentive for the employee to do so indicates that the nature of the benefit is a termination benefit, rather than compensation for senior employees&#39; 20 years or more of service. If so, the benefits should not be accounted for as OPEB. Rather, if the benefits are <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">termination benefits, </b>as the term is used in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs47_par._3">Statement No. 47</span>, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Accounting for Termination Benefits, </b>they should be accounted for in accordance with the applicable requirements of that Statement.</div></body></html>
