For example, if an organization is required to choose its governing body from its membership and employment by the primary government is a requirement for membership in the organization, this would not be the same as the primary government&#39;s appointing the board of the organization. Although it would be true that the employee/board member could be terminated by the primary government, that ability relates to the employment relationship between the primary government and the board member, rather than the position of the employee on the potential component unit board. However, professional judgment should be exercised based on the specifics of each case. For instance, if the articles of incorporation indicate that employees in specific jobs are required to serve (ex officio) on the board of the potential component unit, those board positions would be considered appointments of the primary government.</div></body></html>
