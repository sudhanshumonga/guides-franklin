Rather than require cash and cash equivalents per the statement of cash flows to be the same as similarly titled line items in the statement of net position/balance sheet, paragraph 8 requires that cash and cash equivalents be <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">easily traceable</b> to similarly titled line items in the statements of financial position. This flexibility was provided to allow restricted cash and cash equivalents to be presented separately in the statement of net position/balance sheet. A reconciliation is not necessary if a reader is able to easily trace the statement of cash flows amounts to similarly titled line items in the statement of net position/balance sheet.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">This flexibility also is useful for various other articulation problems, such as the labeling conflict in this question. Because the equity in the pooled cash meets the definition of cash, it may be included in the balance of cash and cash equivalents. If it is labeled as &quot;equity in pooled cash&quot; on the statement of net position/balance sheet, a reader may not be able to easily trace from the statement of cash flows to the statement of net position/balance sheet. Therefore, a reconciliation may be provided—for example, at the bottom of the statement of cash flows—tracing the amounts per the statement of cash flows to the appropriate statement of net position/balance sheet line items.
