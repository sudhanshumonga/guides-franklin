(See <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#ncgas5">National Council on Governmental Accounting [NCGA] Statement 5</span>, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Accounting and Financial Reporting Principles for Lease Agreements of State and Local Governments,</b> as amended, and <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb_op_gasb_62_par__211">paragraphs 211–271</span> of Statement 62, as amended.) The capital and related financing activities category is directly affected by capitalization policies. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#capital_and_related_financing_activities_rec1">paragraph 63</span> of the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 9.) If a lease is a capital lease, the cash flows (including the interest portion) should be included in the capital and related financing activities category—as an inflow in the lessor&#39;s statement of cash flows and as an outflow in the lessee&#39;s statement of cash flows. The lease transaction is essentially treated as an installment sale of a capital asset. The timing of the cash flows does not coincide with the date of the &quot;sale,&quot; but the cash flows are, nevertheless, payments for the purchase of a capital asset. (See the discussion of noncash disclosures in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_noncash_investing_capital_and_financing_activities_rec1">Question 2.32.1</span>.)</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Cash flows resulting from an operating lease, on the other hand, usually should be classified with operating activities. The lessee&#39;s cash payments always should be presented as an operating activities outflow. The lessor&#39;s cash receipts normally should be presented as an operating activities inflow; however, Question 2.20.1 discusses factors that should be evaluated to determine whether lease revenue may be classified as an investing activities inflow.
