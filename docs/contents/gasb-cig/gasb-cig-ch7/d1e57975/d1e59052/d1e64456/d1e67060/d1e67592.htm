The state reports the telecommunications equipment as an asset and the related bonds as a liability of the internal service fund and charges the various state departments for equipment usage. How will the expenses of the internal service fund be allocated among the governmental and business-type activities in the statement of activities? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—There are three main components of this internal service fund&#39;s expenses—interest on the debt, depreciation of the assets, and other operating expenses. In essence, the charges made to the participating departments already &quot;allocate&quot; the internal service fund&#39;s expenses to the governmental and business-type activities. For reporting in the statement of activities, however, two adjustments are necessary: (a) to identify interest expense for separate reporting and (b) to eliminate the &quot;doubling-up&quot; effect of internal charges.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">As explained in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._314">paragraph 314</span> in the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 34, eliminating the &quot;effect&quot; of internal service fund activity requires preparers to &quot;look back&quot; and adjust the internal service fund&#39;s internal charges to break even. However, because interest expense should be reported separately, it first should be added back to the net revenue or expense of the internal service fund. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_231">Question 7.47.9</span>.) The remaining <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">net</b> revenue or expense can then be allocated among the participating functions in the same ratio as the original use charges. This process is illustrated in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_exercise__4_reporting_internal_service_fund_balances_and_results_rec1">Exercise 4</span> of nonauthoritative Appendix B7-3. It is not necessary to make additional adjustments for depreciation expense of the internal service fund assets, but the amount of depreciation expense included in the internal service fund charges should be included in the disclosure required by Statement 34, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._117">paragraph 117d</span>.</div></body></html>
