In the governmental fund statements, the donation should be reported as revenue and ultimately would be included in nonspendable fund balance. For the government-wide statement of activities, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._53">paragraph 53</span> of Statement 34, as amended, requires contributions to permanent funds to be reported separately from, but in the same manner as, general revenues. That is, these sources of financing the net cost of the government’s programs should be reported at the bottom of the statement of activities to arrive at the all-inclusive change in net position for the period. In the government-wide statement of net position, the corpus of the donation should be included in the restricted component of net position, nonexpendable.
