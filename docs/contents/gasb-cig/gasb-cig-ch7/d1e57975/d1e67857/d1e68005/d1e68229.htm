While public entity risk-pools also are required to be reported in enterprise funds, Statement 34, as amended, does not require that state unemployment compensation funds follow the provisions for public entity risk pools in Statement 10, as amended. Paragraph 391 in the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 34 explains the reasons for requiring governments to use the enterprise fund model for unemployment compensation funds and refers to risk-retention operations as “similar.” However, it is not meant to change the way governments (that are already using enterprise funds) report their unemployment compensation programs.</div></body></html>
