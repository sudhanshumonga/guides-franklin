Its board of trustees consists of twelve members who are appointed as follows:</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Four trustees selected by the board of education of the public school unit(s) that is located in the administrative area of the college</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Four trustees selected by the board of commissioners of the county (or counties) in which the college is located</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Four trustees appointed by the governor.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Most of the college&#39;s funding comes from the state and the remainder comes primarily from county appropriations, federal grants, and student tuition and fees. The board of trustees has little discretion over the use of state funds, which are required to be used to finance the college&#39;s basic core programs. The state funds are apportioned to each community college by a formula set by state law that is based on the number of full-time equivalent students.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">All community colleges are regulated by a state agency that:</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Establishes regulations and standards concerning the administration and operation of community colleges</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Sets guidelines for the tuition and fees charged to students.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The governing board of the county considers and approves requests for funding from the college by the same process it uses for appropriations to other groups and organizations that request county funds. The college is entitled to any surpluses and is required to finance any deficits, except that unspent state appropriations revert to the state. It is also legally responsible for its own debt, designates its own management, and controls its day-to-day operations.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The community college would not be reported as a component unit of the state or the county. Unless the county board also appoints the board of education, none of the participating governments appoints a voting majority of the board. Even though the state and the county have some budgetary approval authority, it is compliance-oriented, in connection with funding requests, and would not constitute fiscal dependency. Furthermore, the relationships between the community college and the state or county government do not meet the criteria for inclusion under Statement 39.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The community college would be reported as a joint venture (without equity interests) by the state and the participating county because the financial support provided by the state and the counties to the college represents ongoing financial responsibility. The local boards of education have no ongoing financial responsibilities and thus they would report the college as a jointly governed organization.</div></body></html>
