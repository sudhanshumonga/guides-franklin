The plan issues a stand-alone financial report prepared in conformity with the requirements of Statement 67, as amended. Does the city have to apply all the requirements of Statement 67, as amended, for the pension trust fund?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Although, in general, Statement 67, as amended, applies to financial reporting of the plan in stand-alone financial statements and in circumstances in which the plan is included as a pension trust fund of another government, for purposes of including the pension plan as a pension trust fund in the city’s financial report, footnotes <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs67_fn9">9</span> and <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs67_fn11">11</span> of Statement 67 limit the applicability of the note disclosure and RSI requirements of that Statement to circumstances in which defined benefit pension plan financial statements are presented <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">solely</b> in the financial report of the city. Therefore, because a stand-alone plan financial report is prepared in conformity with the requirements of Statement 67, as amended, that Statement does not require that the city include the information identified in the detailed disclosure and RSI requirements of Statement 67, as amended, as part of its presentation of the pension plan as a pension trust fund in its financial report. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._106">Paragraph 106</span> of Statement 34, as amended, requires that, in this circumstance, the notes to the financial statements of the city include information about how to obtain the stand-alone plan financial report. However, additional information can be presented in the city’s note disclosures if the information is determined to be essential to the fair presentation of the city’s basic financial statements.</div></body></html>
