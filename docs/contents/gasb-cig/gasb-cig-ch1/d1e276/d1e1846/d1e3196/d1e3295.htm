If it is, there appears to be a conflict between Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and Statement 9. Statement 9 provisions may result in statement of net position/balance sheet reporting of &quot;cash and cash equivalents&quot; that differs from deposits. How can a reconciliation between disclosures required by Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and the statement of net position/balance sheet be accomplished given the provisions of Statement 9? How do the provisions of Statement 14 affect the reconciliation?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Statements 3 and 40, as amended, do<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> not</b> require a reconciliation between the disclosures required by those Statements and the statement of net position/balance sheet. However, some preparers have presented one. The different perspectives on financial reporting taken in Statements 3 and 40 and in Statement 9 change the nature of the reconciliation, especially by adding some reconciling items. However, some preparers may continue to believe a reconciliation between the disclosures and the statement of net position/balance sheet would be useful to financial statement users.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If a government reports cash and cash equivalents in its statement of net position/balance sheet, that account might exclude some items that are treated in the disclosures required in Statements 3 and 40, as amended, as deposits—for example, nonnegotiable CDs with an original maturity over three months. Cash and cash equivalents also might include some items that are treated in disclosures required by Statements 3 and 40, as amended, as investments—for example, commercial paper and bankers&#39; acceptances. Statement 9, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#focus_on_cash_and_cash_equivalents_rec1">footnote 5</span>, also allows many investments in open-end mutual funds and external and internal cash management or investment pools to be reported as cash. These funds and pools are reported as investments in disclosures required by Statements 3 and 40, as amended. All of these items of difference, therefore, would be part of a reconciliation between the disclosures required by Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and the statement of net position/balance sheet if one is presented.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> The provisions of Statement 14 result in separate Statement 3 and 40 disclosures for discretely presented component units. In addition, it is possible that not all of those component units will require Statement 3 and 40 disclosures. Because Statement 14 requires that disclosures distinguish between information pertaining to the primary government and that of its discretely presented component units, it follows that a reconciliation could similarly distinguish between the primary government and its discretely presented component units. For the primary government total column presented on the statement of net position, the most likely approach would be to provide reconciliations for the primary government (including its blended component units), the relevant discretely presented component units, and any fiduciary funds.</div></body></html>
