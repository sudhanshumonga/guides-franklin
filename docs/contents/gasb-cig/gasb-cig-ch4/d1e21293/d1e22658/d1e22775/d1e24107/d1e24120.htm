A component unit should be included in only one reporting entity; however, Statement 14 does not suggest that the level of government should be the deciding factor. The potential for dual inclusion arises when a potential component unit is fiscally dependent on, and has a financial benefit or burden relationship with, a government that does not appoint a voting majority of its governing board and the potential component unit otherwise meets the criteria for inclusion in another government&#39;s reporting entity. In this situation, professional judgment is required to determine whether the significance of the combined fiscal dependency and financial benefit or burden relationship outweighs the financial accountability that results from the board appointment. For example, if the question was whether to include a component unit in a city&#39;s or state&#39;s financial reporting entity, it may be useful to include the &quot;lowest level&quot; criterion among the factors being considered in making the final decision.</div></body></html>
