In the example addressed in this question, the developer’s cost for the infrastructure in new residential neighborhoods would be an acceptable method that could be used to determine acquisition value, but other methods—for example, an estimate of the cost associated with the construction of the infrastructure made by the city’s public works department—also may be acceptable.</div></body></html>
