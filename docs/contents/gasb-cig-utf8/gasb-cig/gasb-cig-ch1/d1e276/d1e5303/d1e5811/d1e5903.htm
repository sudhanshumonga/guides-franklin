(See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_146" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_146">Questions 1.64.9 and 1.64.10</span>.) Range notes are investments whose coupon payment varies (for example, either 6 percent or 3 percent) depending on whether the current benchmark (for example, 30-year Treasury) falls within a predetermined range (for example, between 4.75 percent and 5.25 percent). The significant interest rate spread that these investments cover and their reliance on a benchmark interest rate generally cause such notes to be considered highly sensitive investments.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Index amortizing notes are a form of structured note whereby the outstanding principal value amortizes according to a predetermined schedule that is usually linked to a designated index. With these investments, payment schedules are not stable. The timing of future cash flows and, consequently, the average life and the yield-to-maturity of the note remain uncertain. When the underlying index rises above a certain level, the average life of the note usually becomes longer. Conversely, should the index drop below the established level, the principal quickly amortizes according to the schedule. Changes in interest rates can have a substantial impact on the cash flows to be received and, consequently, the fair value of the note.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Step-up notes are another form of an investment that may be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. In a step-up note, the investor holds a note that grants the issuer the option to call the investment on certain specified dates. At each call date, should the issuer not call the note, the coupon rate of the note increases (steps up) by an amount specified at inception. The call feature embedded within a step-up note causes the fair value of the instrument to be highly sensitive to interest rate changes.</div></body></html>
