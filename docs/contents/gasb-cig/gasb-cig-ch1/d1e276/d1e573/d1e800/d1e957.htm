Statement 40, as amended, looks at the risk exposure as of that date as an indicator for potential loss of resources. Risks not present at that date do not offer the same level of predictive value, and therefore the government should evaluate its risk exposure as of the date of the financial statements regardless of the activity between funds during the reporting period. For example, a government holds an investment in XYZ corporate bonds that receive a rating downgrade. If the government moves the bond from its capital projects fund to its general fund during the year, no disclosure of the investment&#39;s risk exposure during the time it was held in the capital projects fund needs to be disclosed.</div></body></html>
