The objectives of the statistical section are different from those of note disclosures and MD&amp;A. Consequently, it may be important to address a component unit in a note or in MD&amp;A, but not important to include it in the statistical section schedules. Conversely, although a government may not deem it necessary to include information about a discretely presented component unit in its notes or MD&amp;A, it may believe that including the component unit is necessary to achieve the objectives of one or more of the categories of statistical section information outlined in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs44_par._6">paragraph 6</span> of Statement 44.</div></body></html>
