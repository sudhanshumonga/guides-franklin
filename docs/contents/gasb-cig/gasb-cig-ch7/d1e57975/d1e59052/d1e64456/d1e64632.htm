How should the operations of those component units be included in the reporting entity&#39;s statement of activities? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Component units that are not program-oriented, and would likely not report their operations in a net program cost format, can be presented in the reporting entity&#39;s statement of activities as if the component unit itself were a single function/program. As a result, all revenues, except those that should be reported as general revenues (taxes, for example), derive from the program and may be reported as program revenues. The specific program revenue classifications can generally be inferred from the manner in which the revenues are reported in the component unit&#39;s operating statement—for example, capital contributions would be reported in the capital grants and contributions column, operating and nonoperating grants would be included in the operating grants and contributions column, and so forth.</div></body></html>
