How does a government determine whether its deposits in the pool are subject to custodial credit risk disclosures?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—In a single financial institution collateral pool, one financial institution pledges a pool of collateral against all the public deposits it holds.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A government's determination of custodial credit risk is the same as the pool's determination:</b> For example, if the fair value of pool collateral is equal to 90 percent of all uninsured public deposits held by the financial institution, and the collateral securities are held by the pledging financial institution's trust department in the name of the pool, 90 percent of the uninsured deposits of each government are covered by the pool and 10 percent are exposed to custodial credit risk.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Pool deposits:</b> To determine the applicability of custodial credit risk disclosures for deposits secured by a single financial institution collateral pool, one should determine the fair value of the collateral in the pool and the total uninsured deposits covered by the pool. Generally, this is not information that an individual government can obtain or verify. Many jurisdictions have assigned a state official (for example, the state's banking commissioner or treasurer) the ability or the authority to administer collateral pools, and governments should contact that official to obtain custodial credit risk information.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">How the securities are held:</b> Some have questioned how to determine whether the deposits are “held in the name of the government” when collateral secures the deposits of more than one individual government. Some assume that because particular securities are not held in the name of particular entities, the criterion can never be met for pools, and all uninsured deposits covered by pools are always exposed to custodial credit risk. This is not the case. Custodians of pooled collateral generally are required to hold the securities in the name of the collateral pool (that is, collectively for the governments secured by the collateral). Provided that this is the case and that an individual government is recognized by the custodian, pledging financial institution, or pool administrator (whichever maintains the "official" list of pool participants) as one of the governments covered by the collateral pool, the "held in the name of the government" criterion is met for that individual government.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Who the securities custodian is:</b> Pooled collateral might be held by the pledging financial institution, automatically requiring custodial credit risk disclosures for all uninsured deposits covered by the pool. Sometimes, the trust department of the pledging financial institution has custody of the pool securities, resulting in deposits not subject to custodial credit risk disclosures, provided that the trust department holds the securities in the name of the pool and the value of the pool meets or exceeds the amount of uninsured deposits.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">However, sometimes a third-party custodian holds the collateral. If this is the case, a determination should be made about whether the custodian is the pledging financial institution's agent or, instead, the agent of the pool (and thus the agent of the governments secured by the pool). (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_agent_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_agent_rec1">Questions 1.15.1 and 1.15.5</span> for the discussion on determining whose agent a custodian is.) Once again, this is a determination best made on a pool-wide basis by the pool administrator. If the custodian acts as the agent of the pool administrator (for example, by obtaining the administrator's approval for all releases of collateral), the uninsured deposits of all governments covered by the pool would not be exposed to custodial credit risk because the collateral is held by the government's agent in the government's name.</div></body></html>
