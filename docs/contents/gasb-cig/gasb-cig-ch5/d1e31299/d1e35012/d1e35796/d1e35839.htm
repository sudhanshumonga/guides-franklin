The fact that a decision of one legislature cannot bind a subsequent legislature should not be considered an indication that the nonemployer contributing entity does not have a legal obligation to make a contribution for the purposes of applying <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_special_funding_situations">paragraph 15</span> of Statement 68. Nor should the circumstance be considered a condition that makes the contribution dependent upon an event or circumstance unrelated to the pensions. Therefore, if the amount of the contribution is defined in such a manner that it meets the criterion in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_special_funding_situations">paragraph 15a</span> of Statement 68 or if the nonemployer entity is the only entity that is legally responsible to make contributions directly to the pension plan, the circumstances would be classified as a special funding situation for purposes of Statement 68, as amended.</div></body></html>
