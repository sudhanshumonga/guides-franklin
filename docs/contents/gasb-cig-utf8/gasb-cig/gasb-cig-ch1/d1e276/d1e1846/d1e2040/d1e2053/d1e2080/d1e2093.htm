For collateral on deposits in financial institutions, the pledging financial institution is a counterparty. For brokerage accounts, the broker or dealer is a counterparty. For repurchase agreements, the seller-borrower in the repurchase agreement is a counterparty. More than one party can be a counterparty in a single transaction for purposes of custodial credit risk. For example, the counterparties in a repurchase agreement can include both the seller-borrower and the broker-dealer or financial institution that acquires the repurchase agreement for the government.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Usually, investment securities are purchased in the securities markets—for example, the Over-the-Counter market and the stock markets. In these transactions, governments and perhaps even their brokers will not know the party that previously owned the securities. Although that selling party technically is a counterparty, the operations of these markets effectively eliminate that party's identity and thereby its rights to the securities. Instead, the important counterparty for purposes of custodial credit risk of investments that are acquired in securities market transactions is the acquiring broker-dealer.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">However, if investment securities are acquired outside of the securities markets—for example, through a direct or private purchase—identifying the party that previously owned them is important to proper disclosure of custodial credit risk. This is because the previous owner may be able to retain access and rights to the securities. To properly disclose the investment in this situation, the preparer should evaluate whether the custodian is either the previous owner of the securities or the <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">trust department </b>or <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">agent</b> of the previous owner. In these transactions, either the government's investment officers or the acquiring broker-dealer will know the identity of the previous owner.</div></body></html>
