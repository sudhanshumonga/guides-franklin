The authority financed the cost of building the facilities by issuing revenue bonds. The county leases the facilities from the authority. The lease payments are equivalent to the debt service requirements of the authority and serve as security for the bonds. The collection of the lease payments from the county and the retirement of the debt are the only activities of the authority. Is the authority required to use enterprise fund accounting and reporting principles in its separate financial statements?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. Even though the authority is a component unit of the county, the county is considered to be &quot;external&quot; relative to the authority&#39;s separate financial statements. Therefore, the provisions of <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._67">paragraph 67</span> of Statement 34, as amended, which stipulate when an enterprise fund may or should be based on fees charged to external users, are applicable. The arrangement meets the criteria in paragraph 67a because the authority&#39;s activity is financed by debt that is secured solely by the lease charges to the county. Furthermore, because the lease payments are structured to be equivalent to the debt service requirements, the criteria in paragraph 67c (that is, the fees and charges are designed to recover all of the authority&#39;s costs) also would indicate that the authority should use the enterprise fund reporting model.
