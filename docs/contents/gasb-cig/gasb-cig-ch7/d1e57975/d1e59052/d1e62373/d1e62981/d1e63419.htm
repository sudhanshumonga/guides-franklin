The blended component unit issued bonds and loaned the proceeds to the primary government for constructing and acquiring capital assets. In its separate financial statements, the financing authority reports the bonds payable and recognizes a loan receivable from the primary government. Accordingly, the primary government recognizes a loan payable to the component unit as a liability and the capital assets acquired and constructed with the proceeds of the loan as assets. When the component unit is blended into the financial reporting entity as a separate enterprise fund, the loan receivable from the primary government and loan payable to the component unit are reclassified as internal balances, as required by Statement 34. For purposes of classifying net position within the reporting entity, does the primary government or the blended component unit have “capital-related” debt? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The primary government’s enterprise fund, in which the capital assets are reported, should consider the loan payable to the component unit as capital-related debt, even though, for presentation purposes, the debt has been reclassified as an internal balance. The blended component unit should regard the bonds payable as noncapital debt because the proceeds were used to acquire the receivable from the primary government, rather than capital assets. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_7.23.12">Question 7.23.12</span>.) That conclusion differs from the answer to <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_138">Question 7.23.11</span>, which addresses an interfund advance within the same legal entity, rather than a borrowing between legally separate entities that has been reclassified.
