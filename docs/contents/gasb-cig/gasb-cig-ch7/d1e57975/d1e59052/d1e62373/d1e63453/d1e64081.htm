The ballot proposition is approved by a majority vote at a subsequent public election. Should the resources generated by the parking meters be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements as net position restricted by enabling legislation?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Although the resources should be reported as restricted net position, they are not restricted by enabling legislation. The voters&#39; approval of the ballot measure is the act that authorizes the installation of the parking meters and restricts the use of the proceeds; the legislation passed by the city council placed the proposition on the ballot, but the approval of the ballot measure authorized the imposition of parking fees. Consequently, the limitation on the use of the proceeds was imposed by parties outside of the reporting government and qualifies as a restriction under <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._34">paragraph 34a</span> of Statement 34, as amended, rather than paragraph 34b.</div></body></html>
