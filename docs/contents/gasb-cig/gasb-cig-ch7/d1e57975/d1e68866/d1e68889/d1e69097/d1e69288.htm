The first step should always be to compare individual fund assets plus deferred outflows of resources, liabilities plus deferred inflows of resources, revenues, and expenditures against 10 percent of the combined element totals for the relevant fund type or category (enterprise or governmental funds). An individual fund is required to first exceed the 10 percent criterion before the second step, the 5 percent test, is undertaken. If an individual element does not surpass the 10 percent cutoff, the 5 percent comparison is not required. Therefore, the government in this question need not make the 5 percent calculation because the category totals do not change and any element that exceeds 10 percent will automatically also exceed 5 percent.</div></body></html>
