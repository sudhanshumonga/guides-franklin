Because the resources initially deposited into the reserve account represent proceeds of debt that were not &quot;attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement&quot; of capital assets, that portion of the debt should be included in the calculation of restricted net position. The resources in the reserve constitute <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">unspent proceeds</b>. If there are accumulated earnings from investing the resources in the reserve account, they should be included in the calculation of either restricted net position or unrestricted net position, as appropriate.
