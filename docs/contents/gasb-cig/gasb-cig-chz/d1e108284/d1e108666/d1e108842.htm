Each grant should be evaluated for elements that qualify as exchanges—for example, patent rights that accrue to the grant provider, or rights to exclusive use of the research results for a period of time. Professional judgment is required to determine if the values exchanged are essentially equal. Elements that do not have the characteristics of an exchange transaction should be accounted for as voluntary nonexchange transactions. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#example_22__research_grant_rec1">Example 22</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix D of Statement 33 illustrates a research grant that has the characteristics of an exchange transaction.</div></body></html>
