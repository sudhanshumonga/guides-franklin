For assets held for public benefit, such as roads, the right to use and enjoy property includes the right to determine how the property is used. All rights may not be vested in a single entity. The term <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">title</b> is used to refer to the right to or ownership of an asset and is also used to refer to the evidence of such ownership. Title may be evidence of legal ownership; however, that ownership may be held for the entity&#39;s own benefit or for the benefit of another entity. Generally, holding title to an asset equates to ownership, and the entity that holds title to an asset should report the asset in its financial statements. However, the facts and circumstances of the situation should be considered. There may be instances in which title is held by one entity, yet some rights of ownership are held by another entity. For example, the lessee reports assets under a capital lease although the lessor holds title.</div></body></html>
