The county reports the debt and the school district reports the capital assets (see Questions <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_127">7.22.12</span> and <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_137">7.23.10</span>); therefore, the debt is not considered to be &quot;capital-related&quot; debt of the county. In the reporting entity financial statements, if the county elects to present an optional &quot;reporting entity&quot; total column, can the debt be reported as capital debt in that total column?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. When the total reporting entity is presented as the reporting unit, the debt <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">is</b> related to capital assets within that reporting unit. Consequently, the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">unrestricted</b> component of net position and the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">net investment in capital assets</b> component of net position of the reporting entity are not equal to a simple combination of those net position components of the primary government and its component units. An explanation of the reclassification could be presented in the notes to the financial statements.</div></body></html>
