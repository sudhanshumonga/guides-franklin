However, paragraph 87 also states that &quot;the realizability assessment may depend on a requirement that the government perform the remediation activities before recovery is considered realizable.&quot; That is, the cost-sharing agreement may require that remediation work first be performed before payment is required. Professional judgment is required to determine how a cost-sharing agreement affects the realizability of recoveries from other parties. Those recoveries should not be recognized as assets before they become realizable.</div></body></html>
