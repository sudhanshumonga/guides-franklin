Storm water activities, as defined in the legislation, include capital projects and operational expenditures. The costs are not expected to be fully recovered through the fee because approximately 25 percent of the costs will be covered through a general fund transfer. Also, depreciation and debt service are not expected to be recovered through the fee. Can the city use a special revenue fund to account for the storm water activity?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. Use of an enterprise fund is not required.
