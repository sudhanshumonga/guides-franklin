Reporting general infrastructure acquired earlier is encouraged at transition but not required. Subsequent to transition, a government should not revise its capitalized amount for a network or subsystem to include assets acquired in years ended before June 30, 1980, if they were not included in the initial network capitalization. To do so would be reporting networks or subsystems on a year-by-year basis, which is not appropriate.
