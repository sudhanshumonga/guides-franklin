Some special purpose governments, for example, may not have the ability to commit resources, and other governments may not have policies that are consistent with the assignment criteria. Other governments may have procedures that constitute assignment of resources but have not taken action to assign any resources. Accordingly, the classifications that a government reports and the policies that are in place will depend on the specific circumstances for the government. </div></body></html>
