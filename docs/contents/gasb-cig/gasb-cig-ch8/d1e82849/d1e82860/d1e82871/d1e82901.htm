However, as used in that Statement, the term usually refers to an employer&#39;s substantive commitment or agreement to provide OPEB—including, for example, provisions or understandings regarding the plan membership, eligibility for benefits, the types of benefits to be provided, the points at which the payment or provision of benefits will begin and end, and the method by which the benefits will be financed. It should be noted, however, that the term may be used in a different sense in some contexts—that is, as referring to a trust or agency fund used to administer the financing and payment of benefits. The context generally should demonstrate in which sense the term is being used.</div></body></html>
