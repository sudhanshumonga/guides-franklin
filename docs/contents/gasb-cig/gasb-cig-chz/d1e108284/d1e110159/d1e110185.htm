The city provides no other form of postemployment healthcare benefits. How should the city account for the COBRA continuation benefits? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>For financial accounting and reporting purposes, COBRA benefits are considered a form of healthcare-related termination benefits, and the city should follow the requirements established in Statement 47, as amended. Generally, Statement 47 requires an employer to calculate and recognize the discounted present value of expected future benefit payments when an offer is accepted (for a voluntary termination) or when a plan of termination, having certain identified criteria, is approved and communicated to employees (for an involuntary termination) and the amounts are estimable. However, the measurement requirements of Statement 47 distinguish healthcare-related termination benefits that are provided as a result of a large-scale, age-related termination event from those healthcare-related termination benefits that are not part of a large-scale, age-related event. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the events that result in a member&#39;s continued participation in the city&#39;s healthcare plan are <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">not</b> part of a large-scale, age-related termination event, Statement 47 allows the city to use the blended premium rates as the basis for the projection of expected future benefit payments. Applied to the scenario in this question, the city would determine the basis for calculating its expected future benefit payments for each COBRA-electing member as follows:</div><div class="table-headcount-0"><div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text">Stated blended premium</div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text">$ 1,980</div></div></div><div><div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text">Less: member contributions</div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text"> <b class="underline ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="underline"> 1,980</b> </div></div></div><div><div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text">Employer contributions</div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text"> <b class="double-underline ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="double-underline">$ 0</b> </div></div></div></div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">As shown above, this approach would result in a determination for accounting purposes that the employer has no expected future benefit payments (and, accordingly, no termination benefit liability) related to the COBRA continuation when the terminated employee contributes the full amount of the blended premium and the termination event is not large scale and age related.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">On the other hand, if the COBRA benefits provided by the city are given as the result of a large-scale, age-related termination—for example, an early-retirement incentive program that targets a significant number of employees—the city&#39;s cost of those benefits should be calculated based on projected total claims costs (or age-adjusted premiums approximating claims costs) for the members electing to participate through COBRA. In this circumstance, if the age-adjusted premium approximating claims costs is determined to be $2,870, the basis for calculating the city&#39;s expected future benefit payments for each COBRA-electing member would be the difference between the projected claims cost (or age-adjusted premium) for the period and the amount that is expected to be contributed toward that cost by the former employee (in this example, the blended premium rate). </div><div class="table-headcount-0"><div><div></div><div></div><div></div></div><div><div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text">Age-adjusted premiums approximating claims costs</div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text">$ 2,870</div></div></div><div><div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text">Less: member contributions</div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text"> <b class="underline ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="underline"> 1,980</b> </div></div></div><div><div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text">Employer contributions</div></div><div><div class="ps_table_cell_text p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_table_cell_text"> <b class="double-underline ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="double-underline">$ 890</b> </div></div></div></div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">In this example, the employer would calculate its termination benefit liability and expense as the discounted present value of expected future benefit payments, using the $890 employer contribution as the basis for projection and considering the healthcare cost trend rate and the discount rate, as required by paragraph 9 of Statement 47.</div></body></html>
