The issuance of warrants, rather than the subsequent acceptance by the treasurer of the warrants, effectively reduces cash. That reduction of cash creates a cash flow. The substance, rather than the legal form, of the warrants should prevail. In a warrant system, participants draw down an available cash balance by issuing warrants. The system operates essentially as an internal cash management pool. It is irrelevant whether a warrant has been redeemed, just as it is irrelevant whether a check has been cashed, for determining cash balance. (See Question 2.11.3 for further explanation of cash flow timing.)</div></body></html>
