Participation is open to legally separate entities that are not component units of the local government. During the year, non-component-unit entities invested in the pool, but at the reporting date the only participants are component units. Should the pooling that occurred during the year be reported as an external investment pool? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. The pool should be reported as an external investment pool. If non-component-unit entities invested in the pool during the year, the external activity should be reported in the sponsoring government&#39;s financial statements in an investment trust fund. This would be the case even though that trust fund would report zero balances in its statement of fiduciary net position as of the reporting date.</div></body></html>
