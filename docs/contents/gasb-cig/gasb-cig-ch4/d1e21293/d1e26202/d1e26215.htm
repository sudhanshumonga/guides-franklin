Therefore, to the extent that the disclosures are essential to the fair presentation, they are required. As noted in paragraph 63 of Statement 14, as amended, “determining which discretely presented component unit disclosures are essential to fair presentation is a matter of professional judgment and should be done on a component unit–by–component unit basis.” <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#focus_of_the_notes_rec1">Paragraph 126</span>, in the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 14, uses the long-term debt disclosure requirements to illustrate how one might decide which component unit disclosures are “necessary for a fair presentation.” For example, paragraph 63, as amended, states that “if a primary government is obligated in some manner for the debt of a particular component unit, it is likely that the debt service requirements to maturity should be disclosed for that component unit.” </div></body></html>
