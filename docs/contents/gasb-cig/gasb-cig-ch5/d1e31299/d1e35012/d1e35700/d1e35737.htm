Paragraph 14 of Statement 68 requires, in that circumstance, that the portion of trust assets segregated to pay benefits to each class of employees be considered assets of a separate defined benefit pension plan for financial reporting purposes. In this case, because each plan is used to provide benefits to more than one employer, each plan would be classified as a separate multiple-employer plan.</div></body></html>
