Required annual contributions to the fund are actuarially determined. Participants pay a pro rata share of the required annual contributions based on total payroll costs for the prior year. The county participates in this fund for its own workers' compensation costs. It has 60 percent of the covered payroll; the local governments have 25 percent of the covered payroll, and not-for-profit organizations have 15 percent of the covered payroll.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> This activity should be accounted for as the county's own risk management activity (in an internal service fund or in the county's general fund) because it is the predominant participant. If at any time the county is no longer the predominant participant, then it should report the activity as a risk-sharing public entity risk pool.</div></body></html>
