Management&#39;s discussion and analysis, other basic financial statements, notes to financial statements, and other required contents are not illustrated; thus, these illustrative financial statements do not meet the minimum requirements for a complete set of GAAP financial statements and required supplementary information.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Exhibits 1 and 2 illustrate selected financial statements for a hypothetical nonprofit fund-raising organization that uses a nongovernmental GAAP reporting model and is a component unit of a public university, based on the application of the criteria in Statement 39. In this example, the university chose to discretely present the foundation by displaying the foundation&#39;s financial statements in their original formats on separate pages. In the university&#39;s reporting entity financial statements, the foundation&#39;s statement of net assets would follow the university&#39;s statement of net position; similarly, the foundation&#39;s statement of activities would be presented on the page following the university&#39;s statement of activities. Although the reporting formats of the foundation, in some ways, are different from those of the university, they are not completely &quot;incompatible.&quot; That is, the information in the foundation&#39;s statements can be reconfigured to allow for a side-by-side columnar presentation with the university. Exhibits 3 and 4 illustrate how the foundation&#39;s financial statements can be modified to conform to the enterprise fund reporting requirements in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34">Statement 34</span>, as amended.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">If the university is a component unit of a state, the component unit financial data in Exhibits 1 and 2 would be required to be combined with the university&#39;s financial data so that the combined totals could be included in the state&#39;s government-wide statements, as required by <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs14_par._50">paragraph 50</span> of Statement 14, as amended. If the university used the side-by-side approach illustrated in Exhibits 3 and 4, it has the option of displaying an entity total column and carrying forward the combined (after eliminations) data from that column to the state&#39;s government-wide statements, or not displaying the total column, but carrying forward the combined totals that would have been displayed in the total column.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_37" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_38" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_39" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_40" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Illustrative Component Unit Note (in the University&#39;s Financial Statements)</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">The following disclosure meets the requirements in </b> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#note_disclosures_rec1"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">paragraph 61</b> </span> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> of Statement 14, as amended, and </b> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._128"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">paragraph 128</b> </span> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> of Statement 34:</b> </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">ABC University Foundation (foundation) is a legally separate, tax-exempt component unit of ABC University (university). The foundation acts primarily as a fund-raising organization to supplement the resources that are available to the university in support of its programs. The seven-member board of the foundation is self-perpetuating and consists of graduates and friends of the university. Although the university does not control the timing or amount of receipts from the foundation, the majority of resources, or income thereon, that the foundation holds and invests are restricted to the activities of the university by the donors. Because these restricted resources held by the foundation can be used by, or for the benefit of, the university only, the foundation is considered a component unit of the university and is discretely presented in the university&#39;s financial statements.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">During the year ended June 30, 20X0, the foundation distributed $20,317,471 to the university for both restricted and unrestricted purposes.

The following sample disclosure satisfies the requirements in paragraph 61, as amended, and includes additional information (similar to the illustrative disclosure above) about the fund-raising foundations that are included in the financial statements of the state university system, one of the state&#39;s discretely presented component units.

Each institution in the system is governed by a Board of Regents. The Boards of Regents consist of five to ten members appointed by the governor, with the advice and consent of the Senate. The state can impose its will on each of the institutions through its ability to modify and approve their budgets and its ability to approve or modify fee (tuition) changes. In addition, the state provides financial support to the colleges and universities through annual operating and capital appropriations. State appropriations paid to the institutions during the year for operating and capital purposes were $30,710,504 and $2,075,750, respectively. Also included in the system are the financial data of the institutions&#39; fund-raising foundations. Although the universities do not control the timing or amount of receipts from their foundations, the majority of resources, or income thereon, that the foundations hold and invest are restricted to the activities of the respective universities by the donors. Because these restricted resources held by the foundations can be used by, or for the benefit of, the specific universities only, the foundations are considered component units of the universities and are included in the universities&#39; financial statements. Separately issued audited financial statements for each college or university may be obtained from the Office of State Finance, 206 Kristin Blvd., Capital City, ST 12543.</div></body></html>
