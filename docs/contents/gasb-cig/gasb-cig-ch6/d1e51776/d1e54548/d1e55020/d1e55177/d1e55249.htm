If a separate report is not issued, the sponsor&#39;s financial statements should include the disclosures required by Statement 31, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#pool_reporting_rec1">paragraph 17</span>, as amended, for such a separate report. Those disclosures include the frequency of determining the fair value of investments, the method used to determine the participants&#39; share sold and redeemed, and other disclosures. In addition, the sponsoring government&#39;s financial statements should make the disclosures required by Statements 3 and 28, as amended, and other cash and investment standards separately for the pool. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_6.43.4">Question 6.43.4</span>.) Finally, the sponsor&#39;s financial statements should disclose condensed statements of fiduciary net position and changes in fiduciary net position for the pool. If the pool includes both internal and external investors (a &quot;<b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">mixed pool</b>&quot;), those condensed financial statements should include, in total, the net position held in trust for all pool participants, and the equity of participants should distinguish between internal and external portions. If the government sponsors more than one external investment pool, the disclosures are required for each pool. (See Statement 31, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs31_par._19">paragraph 19</span>, as amended.)</div></body></html>
