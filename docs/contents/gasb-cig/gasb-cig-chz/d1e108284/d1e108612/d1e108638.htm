Should the plan report those annuity contracts?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The annuity contracts purchased in an individual’s name through an insurance company can be analogized to the allocated insurance contracts discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_statement_of_the_governmental_accounting_standards_board">Statement 67</span>. (The Glossary of that Statement defines an allocated insurance contract as a contract “with an insurance company under which related payments to the insurance company are currently used to purchase immediate or deferred annuities for individual plan members” and notes that such contracts also may be referred to as annuity contracts.) If they are analogized, these types of annuity contracts should be excluded from plan assets. Amounts paid to an insurance company pursuant to the contract should be reported by the plan as benefit payments. Benefits paid by an insurance company in accordance with such a contract should be excluded from benefit amounts reported by the plan.</div></body></html>
