The semiannual coupon is at a fixed rate of 3.95 percent. The bonds will mature on June 30, 20Y2. Also, on July 1, 20X2, the interest rate lock is terminated by the school district. The interest rate lock has a positive fair value to the school district of $808,976, resulting in a payment to the school district from the counterparty. In the government-wide financial statements, the payment is reported as an asset. The deferred inflow of resources is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in a systematic and rational manner over the life of the fixed-rate bonds because the school district is not reexposed to interest rate risk upon the issuance of the fixed-rate bonds.</div></body></html>
