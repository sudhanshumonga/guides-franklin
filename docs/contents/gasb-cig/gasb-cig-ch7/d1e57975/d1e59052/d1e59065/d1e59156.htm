Even though this combined &quot;single-function&quot; approach would report the net (expense) revenue of the component unit in a separate column, users would not be able to distinguish between the expenses and program revenues of the primary government and its component units. Paragraph 14 of Statement 34 expands the meaning of discrete presentation to cover separate <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">rows</b> as well as columns. It states, &quot;Separate rows and columns should be used to distinguish between the total primary government and its discretely presented component units.&quot;</div></body></html>
