Is this considered an on-behalf payment for fringe benefits under Statement 24, as amended? That is, should the component unit gross up a revenue and expenditures/expense for those state-paid OPEB? Does the answer differ if the state payments are made in advance (and thus while the personnel are working and still are employees) or on a pay-as-you-go basis (and thus made while the personnel are retired and thus no longer are employees)? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Payments by a state government for the cost of health insurance for a component unit&#39;s retirees are on-behalf payments for fringe benefits, as the term is used in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs24_par._7">paragraph 7</span> of Statement 24, and the employer government and the paying government should account for them in conformity with the requirements of Statement 24. The types of on-behalf payments listed in the second sentence of paragraph 7, including &quot;employee health and life insurance payments,&quot; are not necessarily all-inclusive and should not be viewed as excluding retiree health and life insurance payments. The preceding is not affected by the method of financing the benefits—that is, by whether payments are made on an actuarial or pay-as-you-go-basis. If the state is legally responsible for the payments, the component unit would report expense equal to the on-behalf revenue recognized from the state. If the component unit is legally responsible, the component unit would recognize expense based on the requirements of Statement 45, as amended.</div></body></html>
