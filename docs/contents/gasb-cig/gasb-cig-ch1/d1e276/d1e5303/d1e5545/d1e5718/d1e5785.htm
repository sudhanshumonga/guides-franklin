The simulation model is designed to estimate changes in an investment&#39;s or a portfolio&#39;s fair value, given hypothetical changes in interest rates. Many investments or portfolios illustrate adverse changes in fair values from increasing interest rates; however, governments may have investments or portfolios in which the opposite would be true. In these cases, governments using the simulation model would disclose the scenario in which a decrease in interest rates would adversely affect the instrument&#39;s or portfolio&#39;s fair value. The simulation model method of disclosing interest rate risk is designed to show how changes in interest rates will negatively affect an investment&#39;s or a portfolio&#39;s fair value.</div></body></html>
