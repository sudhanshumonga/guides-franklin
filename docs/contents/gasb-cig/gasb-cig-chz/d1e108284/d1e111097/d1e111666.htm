The private-sector entity is legally obligated by the terms of the lease to conduct and pay for all cleanup activities. The land becomes polluted and an environmental regulator names both the private-sector entity and the county as responsible parties. Should the county record a pollution remediation expense and liability? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>Paragraph 14 of Statement 49 notes that “pollution remediation liabilities should be measured based on the pollution remediation outlays expected to be incurred to settle those liabilities.” Paragraph 19 of that Statement elaborates on the concept by stating that the measurement also should include remediation work “expected to be performed for other responsible parties or PRPs.” If the private-sector entity is financially capable of paying for the remediation work and the county expects all remediation work to be performed by the private-sector entity, then the county would not record a pollution remediation expense or liability because the expected cash flow would be zero. However, if the private-sector entity is not financially capable of paying for the remediation work, or if the county expects to incur some outlays for the project, then the county would report an expense and liability based on the recognition guidance in Statement 49.</div></body></html>
