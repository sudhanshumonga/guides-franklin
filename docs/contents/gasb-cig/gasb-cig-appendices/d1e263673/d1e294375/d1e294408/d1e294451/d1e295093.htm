(See Table A-4.) This amount represents a net increase (including additions and deductions) of $11.7 million, or 3.7 percent, over last year.</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The City&#39;s fiscal year 20X3 capital budget projects spending another $16 million for capital projects, principally for the completion of the final phase of the Route 7 construction project and to create housing units in Finden Acres, the City&#39;s new community redevelopment housing program. The City has no plans to issue additional debt to finance these projects. Rather, we will use bond proceeds from the community redevelopment bonds issued this year and resources on hand in the City&#39;s gas tax fund. More detailed information about the City&#39;s capital assets is presented in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_note_1_information_about_capital_assets">Note 1</span> to the financial statements.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Long-Term Debt</b> </div><div class="keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab"> At year-end the City had $158 million in bonds and notes outstanding, an increase of 12 percent over last year—as shown in Table A-5.

In addition, to improve cash flow and to take advantage of lower interest rates, the City management decided to refinance nearly $43 million of two general obligation debt issues and two revenue bond issues by issuing refunding bonds. By refinancing the debt, the City will reduce its debt service payments by $2.3 million over the next 15 years.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2"></div><div class="ps_materiality_box p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_materiality_box"> <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Limitations on Debt</b>The State limits the amount of general obligation debt the City can issue to 3 percent of the assessed value of all taxable property within the City&#39;s corporate limits.
