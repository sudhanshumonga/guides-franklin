The concept of blending is based on the notion that certain component units are so closely related to the primary government that they are, in substance, the same as the primary government. As stated in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#blending_component_units_rec1">paragraph 52</span> of Statement 14, as amended, the component unit&#39;s balances and transactions should be reported in a manner similar to the balances and transactions of the primary government itself. Therefore, if a component unit is blended into the reporting entity&#39;s financial statements as a special revenue fund, for example, it would be evaluated against the major fund criteria with the reporting entity&#39;s other governmental funds.</div></body></html>
