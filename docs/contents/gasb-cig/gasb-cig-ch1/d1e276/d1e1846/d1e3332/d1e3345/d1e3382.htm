As a practical matter, however, they often are. Uncollected funds arise when a government makes a deposit in a financial institution and the government&#39;s account is credited for the deposit, but the depository financial institution has not yet received the money from the payor&#39;s financial institution. The amount of such uncollected funds can be significant, in some cases amounting to millions of dollars daily.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the FDIC liquidates a financial institution, the authority of the liquidation trustee is limited to those funds actually in the possession of the financial institution at the time it enters into liquidation. Funds collected after that time would be returned to the depositor rather than placed in the pool of assets managed by the liquidation trustee. Therefore, uncollected funds are not exposed to credit risk from the depository financial institution and should not be considered part of the bank balance.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Governments may not know precisely when their bank collects funds. Governments will know their posted balance. Balances are posted when deposits are made, and the posted balance obviously would include uncollected funds. Therefore, the posted balance would be greater than the <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">collected funds balance.</b> </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Using the posted balance for deposits is a practical alternative to trying to determine the collected funds balance. If a portion of the posted balance is uncollateralized and uninsured, and the preparer believes that a significant portion of those deposits may represent uncollected funds, the preparer may wish to consult with the financial institution to determine the collected funds balance, so as not to misrepresent the custodial credit risk exposure of the government&#39;s deposits.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Deposits made into an account may not be available for withdrawal for some period of time. Using the <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">available balance</b> as the bank balance also may be practical, provided that a financial institution&#39;s policy for making funds available to a government is consistent with the financial institution&#39;s collection of those funds. In some cases, however, it would not be appropriate to use the available balance. These would be cases in which the period between posting and availability of a deposit does not coincide with the actual collection of funds by the depository financial institution. As a result, the available balance may not include funds that have been collected, because of a lag between when a bank collects funds and when the bank allows its customers to use the funds. Therefore, the available balance may be less than the collected funds balance. Using the available balance in this situation would not fully report the government&#39;s credit risk exposure in deposits with financial institutions.</div></body></html>
