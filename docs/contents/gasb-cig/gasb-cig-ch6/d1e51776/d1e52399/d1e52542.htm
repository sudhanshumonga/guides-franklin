If the restriction is a characteristic of the asset (for example, the sale of a security in a private offering), the restriction is taken into consideration by market participants and, consequently, should be incorporated into the fair value measurement. If the restriction is a characteristic of the government and is unrelated to the asset (for example, the asset has been pledged as collateral), the restriction should not be reflected in the fair value measurement. </div></body></html>
