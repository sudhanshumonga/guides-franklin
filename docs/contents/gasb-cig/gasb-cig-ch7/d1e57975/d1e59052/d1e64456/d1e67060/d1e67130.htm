DHR receives all of its &quot;funding&quot; through this allocation mechanism. Should this internal activity be treated as reimbursements, or do the charges represent program revenue of DHR? Are the charges to the various state agencies direct or indirect expenses? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Because of the standard allocation formula used by DHR, it is unlikely that the expenses are &quot;directly attributable&quot; to the various agencies. Thus, they should be treated as indirect expenses, and the allocations should either be reversed completely for the statement of activities or be reversed and displayed in the separate column. The charges appear to be designed to &quot;spread&quot; costs and therefore constitute reimbursements rather than program revenues.</div></body></html>
