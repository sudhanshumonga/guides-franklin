The financial statements of component unit A include financial data for its component unit B for the fiscal year ending June 30, 20X3. Therefore, component unit B&#39;s data will be one year old when they are &quot;rolled up&quot; into the reporting entity financial statements. How should this information be reported in the reporting entity financial statements? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The reporting entity should incorporate the financial statements of component unit A as described in paragraph 59. Statement 14 is applicable to the separately issued financial statements of a component unit. Paragraph 43 states that the financial reporting entity definition should be applied &quot;from the bottom up.&quot; This means that the primary government&#39;s component unit would include the financial data of its component units that have different year-ends based on the guidance provided in paragraph 59, and the primary government would do the same. Therefore, it would be appropriate for component unit A to include the June 30, 20X3, financial information of component unit B in its December 31, 20X3, financial statements. Likewise, it would be appropriate for the reporting entity to include this information in its June 30, 20X4, financial statements through the incorporation of the December 31, 20X3, financial statements of component unit A.</div></body></html>
