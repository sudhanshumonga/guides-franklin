The Statement defines the categories from a functional perspective. Although the operating activities category also is defined, it serves as the residual category. Therefore, cash flow transactions should be evaluated first according to the definitions of capital and related financing, noncapital financing, and investing activities before being included in the operating activities category.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The operating activities category of the statement of cash flows is not intended to be a cash-basis operating statement. The format prescribed in Statement 9 is intended to complement the accrual-basis financial statements. In addition, the presentation is not intended to imply that one category is more desirable than any other category. Therefore, there should be no predilection for classifying cash flows in the operating activities category or any other category.</div></body></html>
