These two independent sub-systems are:<ul id="ul_sys_4rt_qr" class="ul"><li class="li">Internal Security Services</li><li class="li">External Security Services</li></ul>These two independent sub-systems manage access to the <em class="term display-inline">ClusterBalance</em> services by internal nodes and access to the entire <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> solution by external parties, including the <em class="term display-inline">MobileView</em> client interface. </div><div id="section_anf_3bz_qr" class="section"><h2 class="title">Security Threats</h2><div class="p">By default, <em class="term display-inline">ClusterControl</em> refuses to accept client requests from hosts not listed in the cluster. If the system is started on the unlisted host, the daemons continue to retry the connection. The master host rejects these requests, but if there are many unlisted hosts doing the same thing, it may become overloaded and be unable to respond to valid requests.</div><div class="p">Since <em class="term display-inline">ClusterControl</em> can handle large clusters (several thousand hosts in a cluster) and is designed to be resistant to this type of attack, a malicious attack needs to simulate a larger scale of false hosts in order to be successful, but theoretically <em class="term display-inline">ClusterControl</em> still remains potentially vulnerable to a very large-scale attack. Administrators must still plan their security architecture and establish continuous monitoring processes. </div><div class="p">With effective security administration procedures in place, the security of <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> is formidable. The scalability of the security regime is derived from the fact that administrative controls are applied in a top-down fashion while rights to resources are defined in a bottom-up fashion. Clusters will have specific rights assigned regarding the resources that they can request and process.</div></div></body></html>
