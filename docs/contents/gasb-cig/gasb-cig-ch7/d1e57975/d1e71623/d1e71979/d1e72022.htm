One essential characteristic of a segment is that it is an &quot;identifiable activity.&quot; The &quot;identifiable activity&quot; is the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">source</b> of the pledged revenues. If the bond indenture specified that the pledged revenues were the fees from all the dorms, the dorm <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">system</b> would be the identifiable activity. In this case, however, because each dorm&#39;s debt is secured by its own revenues, segment disclosures should be made for <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">each</b> of the 10 residence halls that meet <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">all</b> the criteria in paragraph 122, as amended. The primary purpose of the disclosure required by paragraph 122, as amended, is to provide information about &quot;coverage&quot; of pledged revenues, not to disaggregate all of the operating results of enterprise funds.</div></body></html>
