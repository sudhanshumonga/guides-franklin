The board of the foundation is not appointed by the hospital. The foundation operates a gift shop in the hospital and has helped finance several of the hospital&#39;s capital projects including the building of a new children&#39;s wing. All of the profits from the gift shop are used to buy new furniture for the hospital. The foundation buys the furniture and donates it to the hospital. The foundation&#39;s resources, to which the hospital is entitled, are significant to the hospital&#39;s financial statements.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>MLC Memorial Hospital Foundation is a component unit of the hospital and should be discretely presented in the hospital&#39;s reporting entity financial statements. Because the foundation&#39;s charter establishes the hospital as its exclusive beneficiary, the &quot;direct benefit&quot; criterion is met; likewise, the &quot;entitlement/ability to access&quot; criterion is satisfied as a result of the history of support provided by the foundation. In addition, the economic resources received or held by the foundation that the hospital is entitled to are significant to the hospital. </div></body></html>
