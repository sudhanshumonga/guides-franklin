Interest rate swaps can be in either an asset or a liability position at a given measurement date. When a government holds an interest rate swap that is in a liability position, the requirements for measuring fair value of a liability apply to the measurement of that interest rate swap liability. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_nonperformance_risk_">Paragraph 62</span> of Statement 72 requires a government to consider the nonperformance risk when measuring the fair value of a liability. Therefore, when measuring the fair value of an interest rate swap that is in a liability position, a government should consider the effect of the government’s own credit quality (for example, its credit standing) and any other factors that might affect the likelihood that the obligation will or will not be fulfilled.</div></body></html>
