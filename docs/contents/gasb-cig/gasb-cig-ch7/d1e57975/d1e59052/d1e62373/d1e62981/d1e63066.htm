That is, if debt is capital related, those amounts would be included in the calculation of the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">net investment in capital assets</b> component of net position. If the debt is restricted for a specific purpose and the proceeds are unspent, the net proceeds would affect the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">restricted</b> component of net position. Reporting both within the same component of net position prevents one classification from being overstated while another is understated by the same amount.
