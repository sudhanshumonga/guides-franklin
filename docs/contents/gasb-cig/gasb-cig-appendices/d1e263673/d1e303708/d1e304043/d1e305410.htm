In addition to operating expenses related to current activities of the landfill sites, an expense provision and related liability are being recognized based on the future closure and postclosure care costs that will be incurred near or after the date the landfills no longer accept waste. The recognition of these landfill closure and postclosure care costs is based on the amount of the landfills used (capacity) during the year. The estimated liability for landfill closure and postclosure care costs is $26,596,649 as of June 30, 20X2, which is based on 54 percent usage (filled) of the landfill. It is estimated that an additional $23,048,197 will be recognized as closure and postclosure care expenses between the date of the balance sheet and the date the landfills are currently expected to be filled to capacity (the year 20X3). The estimated total current cost of the landfill closure and postclosure care ($49,644,846) is based on the amount that would be paid if all equipment, facilities, and services required to close, monitor, and maintain the landfills were acquired as of June 30, 20X2. However, the actual cost of closure and postclosure care may be higher due to inflation, changes in technology, or changes in landfill laws and regulations.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">In addition, the County is required by State and Federal laws and regulations to make annual contributions to finance closure and postclosure care. The County is in compliance with these requirements, and at June 30, 20X2, investments of $26,596,649 are part of the pooled funds held by the County Treasurer and are presented on the Solid Waste Fund statement of net position as restricted assets.</div></body></html>
