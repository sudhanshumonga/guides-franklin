The authority also has a business-type component unit that meets the criteria for discrete presentation. Statement 34, paragraph 125, as amended, states that the requirements for discrete presentation should be met by displaying the component unit financial data in the government-wide statements of net position and activities. How should the authority&#39;s component unit be reported? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The component unit financial data can be reported in one of two ways. Because the authority follows the guidance in paragraph 138, as amended, there are no government-wide statements to use for reporting component unit information. The authority could insert the component unit column to the right of the required total column on the enterprise fund financial statements. Only the statement of net position and change statement for the component unit would be presented. Cash flow information for the component unit is not required. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_2_question_2">Questions 2.4.2 and 2.4.3</span>.) Alternatively, the authority could present the enterprise fund total columns for the statement of net position and the statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position on separate pages and include the component unit data to the right of the total columns on those separate pages—in effect, a &quot;government-wide&quot; style presentation.</div></body></html>
