Although the benefit terms provide for an individual account for each plan member and define contributions to be made by the employer during the member’s periods of active service, employer contributions to the account also are required after the plan member’s active service period. Thus, the employer should apply the requirements of Statement 45, as amended, applicable to defined benefit plans.</div></body></html>
