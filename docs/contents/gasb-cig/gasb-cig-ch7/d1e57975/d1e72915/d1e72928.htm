It presents a short list of typical general purpose governments—states, cities, counties, towns, and villages—but other forms, such as boroughs and certain townships, may also be considered &quot;general purpose.&quot; General purpose governments are thought to be those that offer more than one type of <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">basic governmental services—</b>for example, general government, public safety, transportation, health and welfare. Special-purpose governments generally provide a limited (or sometimes a single) set of services or programs—for example, fire protection, library services, mosquito abatement, or drainage.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The general purpose/special-purpose distinction is important to clarify that references and illustrations to general purpose governments throughout Statement 34 should not be interpreted as limiting its applicability to only those governments. It also helps in understanding that <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">all</b> provisions need not be applied to <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">all</b> governments. Nevertheless, a definition of <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">special-purpose</b> is not required to determine the applicability of the provisions in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#basic_financial_statements_required_for_special-purpose_governments__rec1">paragraphs 134–141</span> of Statement 34, as amended. The term <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">special-purpose</b> could have been omitted from those paragraphs without losing any of the clarity of the explanations. For example, paragraph 136 applies to <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">any governments</b> engaged in a single governmental program, paragraph 138 applies to <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">any governments</b> engaged only in business-type activities, and paragraph 139 applies to <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">any governments</b> engaged only in fiduciary activities.</div></body></html>
