(See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_25">Question 1.6.1</span> for a discussion of what constitutes legal provisions.)</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">What constitutes a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">significant</b> violation is a matter of professional judgment. However, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">significant</b> connotes qualitative as well as quantitative features. A significant violation would not necessarily be restricted to one that involves a large dollar investment or a large dollar risk of loss. Qualitative features to be considered include the specific wording of the legal or contractual provisions, the reason for the provisions, the current political environment, whether such a violation would affect the actions or accountability assessment of the financial statement users, and whether the lack of control that allowed a small dollar violation potentially could allow a future violation involving a much larger dollar investment or larger dollar risk of loss. For example, suppose a government that is required by law to fully collateralize uninsured deposits had a small amount of uncollateralized deposits during the reporting period because it has no procedures to monitor the value of collateral. This situation could be considered a significant legal violation because the lack of procedures could result in higher levels of uncollateralized deposits in the future. Moreover, some believe any violations of legal provisions relating to collateral requirements and the use of unauthorized investment types are inherently significant in a qualitative sense and should be disclosed, regardless of the dollar amount involved.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">This disclosure should only be as detailed as needed to inform users.
