Legal provisions are those requirements that carry the force of law.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Legislation that governs the deposits and investments of a state government or its local political subdivisions usually is in one of three forms. The first form provides a detailed list of permissible deposits and investments (a <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">legal list</b>) and other requirements, such as for custody of collateral on deposits and of investment securities. Many state statutes use this form. The second form, commonly used for pension fund and other fiduciary investments, is a <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">prudent-person</b> or <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">prudent-expert</b> rule. These rules are broad statements of intent, generally requiring investment selection and management to be made with prudent, discreet, and intelligent judgment and care. Additional investment objectives may be given in a prudent-person or prudent-expert rule, for example, to consider safety of principal before investment yield. The third form of state deposit and investment legislation is <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">home-rule authority,</b> which allows local governments to enact their own investment legislation. Sometimes local governments are given home-rule authority in some investment areas (such as investment selection) and detailed statutory requirements in others (such as a requirement to have collateral on deposits).</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">State investment legislation, supplemented by legal requirements established by the governing body or other oversight body of the state or local governmental entity or agency, should be used in applying the requirements of paragraphs 65 and 66, as amended. For example, if state statutes provide that the investments of a pension plan should be guided by a prudent-person rule and there are no other legal requirements concerning investments for the system, the prudent-person rule should be the basis for the disclosures required by paragraphs 65 and 66, as amended. If, however, the system's board of trustees establishes detailed investment policies and board actions constitute legal requirements, the disclosures should be based on the board's policies. Similarly, local ordinances enacted by a local government with home-rule authority should be the basis for the disclosures.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Although important to an entity's portfolio management, investment policies that are not legal requirements are not required to be used as a basis for paragraphs 65 and 66 disclosures, as amended. For example, if state law is silent on custodial arrangements for investment securities but it is the policy of the office of the state treasurer to have independent third-party custody, that policy is not a legal provision. Therefore, although violation of that custodial policy should be of concern to management, Statement 3 does not require its disclosure in the notes to financial statements.
