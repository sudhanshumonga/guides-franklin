		<h1>RoboHelp 2019 - Frameless Output</h1>
		<p>RoboHelp 2019 introduces truly frameless outputs, no iFrames at all.</p>
		<ul style="list-style: disc;">
			<li>iFrames limited how Google indexing and search worked for online
				help, the frameless skin will result in improvements there.</li>
			<li>Each topic has a unique simpler URL</li>
			<li>The skin editor allows significantly more customization.</li>
			<li>You can choose to have a Home Page, No Home Page (goes to default
				topic) or a Home Page with the default topic as well.</li>
			<li>Mini TOC built in.</li>
			<li>Advanced users will be able to modify these skins outside of the
				skin editor or create their own skins as they could in Classic versions.
				Such editing and creation is done outside of RoboHelp using other
				HTML editors such as Adobe Dreamweaver. Skins edited or created this
				way are not supported for further editing in the skin editor.</li>
			<li>Frameless skins are GDPR compliant. Users will have the option
				to accept or reject the writing of the cookie that records acceptance.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="show_me">Show Me</h2>
		<h3 id="home_page_only">Home Page Only</h3>
		<p>The home page shows icons to access the top level books in the table
			of contents.</p>
		<p><img src="../../assets/images/rh2019/images/orange01.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"></p>
		<p>All the books above are shown with the default images. You can change
			that in the skin editor. In the Layout Page tab go to TOC Tile Images
			to set your default images. If you set just two images, the images will
			be applied to every other book. If you set three or more, they will be
			applied in series.</p>
		<p>In the TOC editor you can apply different images to each book or page,
			just click the book or page and select Properties.</p>
		<p>In the skin editor you can set your image to cover the whole area and
			have the text sit on top of the image. In the skin editor Home Page tab,
			set the background opacity for tile-details-box to zero and the font color
			to whatever you require. The font color for the number of articles is
			set in tile-topics-count. Note that the settings in the skin editor will
			apply to all the books.</p>
		<h3 id="no_home_page">No Home Page</h3>
		<p>This will open with the default topic displayed and work more like traditional
			help. Note though, no frames! It's all done with DIV tags.</p>
		<p><img src="../../assets/images/rh2019/images/frameless_02.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"></p>
		<h3 id="home_page_and_d">Home Page and Default Topic</h3>
		<p>This is simply the home page you see in the first image with your default
			topic below it.</p>
		<h2 id="editing_framele">Editing Frameless Skins</h2>
		<p>The frameless skin editor has many more options than ever before and
			you will likely find you can create whatever you want by digging into
			the editing tabs. As you drill down through the various options, the image
			will be highlighted to show the area you are working on.</p>
		<h3 id="the_layout_tab">The Layout Tab</h3>
		<p><img src="../../assets/images/rh2019/images/frameless_03.png" alt="" class="Spacing_Top_Only" border="0"></p>
		<h3 id="the_home_page_t">The Home Page Tab</h3>
		<p><img src="../../assets/images/rh2019/images/frameless_04.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"></p>
		<h3 id="the_topic_page_">The Topic Page Tab</h3>
		<p><img src="../../assets/images/rh2019/images/frameless_05.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"></p>
		<h3 id="the_options">The Options</h3>
		<p>There are more options than ever before and it is beyond the scope of
			this sample project to cover them all.</p>
		<h4 id="some_highlights">Some Highlights</h4>
		<ul class="Standard_Bullet">
			<li class="Standard_Bullet">All the text can be set to your preferred
				fonts, weights and colors.</li>
			<li class="Standard_Bullet">Colors and images can all be changed.</li>
			<li class="Standard_Bullet">The size of different areas can be set
				as required.</li>
			<li class="Standard_Bullet">Borders can be set to whatever width you
				want and have square or round corners.</li>
			<li class="Standard_Bullet">The skins have a Download PDF button. In
				the preset layout tab you can define the path enabling users to download
				a PDF of the help. If you don't want to use that option, delete the
				button from the skin.</li>
			<li class="Standard_Bullet">The skin is created from the DIVs defined
				in the EJS and the supporting CSS files. Expert users can edit those
				as well but the skin editor should cover most requirements.</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="cancelling_gene">Cancelling Generation</h2>
        <p>While an output is being generated, you can click the Cancel icon at
            any time.</p>
        <p><img src="../../assets/images/images/cancel_generation.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"></p>
        <h2 id="generation_erro">Generation Errors</h2>
        <p>When you generate an output using Quick Generate, if it fails for any
            reason click the Error icon to access the log.</p>
        <p><img src="../../assets/images/rh2019/images/generate_failure.png" alt="" style="border: none;" border="0"></p>
        <p>If you generated directly from the preset, you will get an error message.
            Right click the preset and click View Log.</p>
