However, when one employer is legally responsible for almost all contractually required contributions to a cost-sharing plan, and that level of responsibility is ongoing and is unlikely to change significantly in the foreseeable future, that employer is encouraged to apply the sole-employer requirements of Statement 45, rather than the cost-sharing requirements, because the plan relies for its funding almost entirely on contributions from the one employer. It should be noted that a decision to apply the sole-employer requirements of Statement 45 would not affect financial reporting for the plan or for other participating employers in the plan, as discussed in Question 8.46.3.</div></body></html>
