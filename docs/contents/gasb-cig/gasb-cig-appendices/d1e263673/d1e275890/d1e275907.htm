On the cityâ€™s statement of net position, when an internal service fund is used, the $3 million in unpaid claims would be reported as a liability of either governmental or business-type activities, as appropriate. The $2 million difference between the fund liability and the $3 million in unpaid claims is developed when the internal service fund is eliminated, and it should be included in the reconciliations between fund financial statements and the statements of net position and activities. An example of the conversion of internal service fund balances in the statement of net position and results in the statement of activities can be found in nonauthoritative Appendix B7-3, Exercise 4.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">On July 1, 20X4, the city contributes another $10 million to its account in the pool. During the fiscal year, the pool pays $7 million in claims for the city (including the $3 million unpaid claims accrued as of June 30, 20X4). At June 30, 20X5, the city and pool determine that there is an additional $1 million in unpaid claims, both reported and IBNR. At that date, the city would report in the internal service fund claims expenses of $5 million and a deposit of $4 million. The following illustrates how the liability and deposit amounts in the internal service fund were determined:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div></body></html>
