The terms <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">activity</b> and <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fund</b> are not synonymous; that is, &quot;activity&quot; generally refers to programs or services, whereas a &quot;fund&quot; is an accounting and reporting device. A single fund could account for several activities and a single activity could be accounted for in multiple funds. As indicated in paragraph 15 of Statement 34, the statement of activities <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">usually</b> follows the categorizations used in the fund financial statements—governmental activities are those that usually are accounted for in governmental funds, and business-type activities are those that usually are accounted for in enterprise funds. Nevertheless, governments can realign their activities if they believe that this would more faithfully represent their operating objectives and philosophies. The reconciliations from the governmental and enterprise fund financial statements to the government-wide statements would explain the reclassification.</div></body></html>
