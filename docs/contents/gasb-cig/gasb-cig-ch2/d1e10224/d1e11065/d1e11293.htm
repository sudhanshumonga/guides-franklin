However, changes in fair value (or amortization) of investments that meet the definition of cash equivalents in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs9_par._9">paragraph 9</span> of Statement 9 should be reported as cash flows from investing activities. These changes are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are so near their maturity that they present insignificant risk of changes in value because of changes in interest rates. When the net increase (decrease) in the fair value of investments is reported in the change statement as part of operating income, the change is presented as an element in the reconciliation of operating income to net cash provided by operating activities.
