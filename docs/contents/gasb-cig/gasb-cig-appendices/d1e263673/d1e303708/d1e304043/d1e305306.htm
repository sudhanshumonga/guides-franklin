Article 40 of the Statutes of the State assigns the authority to establish and amend benefit provisions to SGRS board of trustees. The SGRS issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for SGRS. The report may be obtained by writing to the State General Retirement System, State Government Lane, Latte, GR 00100, or by accessing the SGRS website at www.StateGeneralRetirement.gov.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Article 40 provides that contribution requirements of the plan members and the participating employers are established and may be amended by the SGRS board of trustees. Plan members or beneficiaries receiving benefits contribute $75 per month for retiree-only coverage and $145 per month for retiree and spouse coverage to age 65, and $55 and $125 per month, respectively, thereafter. </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Participating employers are contractually required to contribute at a rate assessed each year by the SGRS, currently 10.75 percent of annual covered payroll. The SGRS board of trustees sets the employer contribution rate based on the annual required contribution of the employers (ARC), an amount actuarially determined in accordance with the parameters of GASB Statement No. 45, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Accounting and Financial Reporting by Employers for Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions</b>, as amended. The ARC represents a level of funds that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities (or funding excess) of the plan over a period not to exceed 30 years. The County’s contributions to the SGRS for the years ended June 30, 20X2, 20X1, and 20X0 were $1,280,717, $1,090,886, and $1,047,375, respectively. The County’s contributions equaled the required contributions each year.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Public Safety Personnel Plan (PSPP)</b> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The County’s PSPP provides medical benefits to eligible retired County public safety employees and their beneficiaries. The PSPP is affiliated with the Retired Public Safety Employees Health Plan (RPSEHP), an agent multiple-employer postemployment health care plan administered by the State Retirement System. Article 41 of the State’s statutes assigns the authority to establish and amend the benefit provisions of the plans that participate in RPSEHP to the respective employer entities. For the PSPP, that authority rests with the County. The RPSEHP issues a publicly available financial report that includes financial statements and required supplementary information for RPSEHP. That report may be obtained by writing to Retired Public Safety Employees Health Plan, 399 Grocer Aisle Way, GR 00100 or by accessing the RPSEHP website at www.RPSafetyplan.gov.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The contribution requirements of plan members and the County are established by the RPSEHP board of trustees. PSPP members receiving benefits contribute $75 per month for retiree-only coverage and $150 per month for retiree and spouse coverage to age 65, and $40 and $80 per month, respectively, thereafter. The County is required to contribute the ARC, an amount that, if paid on an ongoing basis, is projected to cover normal cost each year and amortize any unfunded actuarial liabilities (of funding excess) over a period not to exceed 30 years. The current ARC rate is 13.75 percent of annual covered payroll.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">For 20X2, the County’s annual OPEB cost (expense) of $870,517 for PSPP was equal to the ARC. The County’s annual OPEB cost, the percentage of annual OPEB cost contributed to the plan, and the net OPEB obligation for 20X2 and the two preceding years were as follows: </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_134bk" class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The funded status of the plan as of June 30, 20X2, was as follows:</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_134bl" class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Actuarial valuations of an ongoing plan involve estimates of the value of reported amounts and assumptions about the probability of occurrence of events far into the future. Examples include assumptions about future employment, mortality, and the healthcare cost trend. Amounts determined regarding the funded status of the plan and the annual required contributions of the employer are subject to continual revision as actual results are compared with past expectations and new estimates are made about the future. The schedule of funding progress, presented as required supplementary information following the notes to the financial statements, presents multiyear trend information that shows whether the actuarial value of plan assets is increasing or decreasing over time relative to the actuarial accrued liabilities for benefits.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Projections of benefits for financial reporting purposes are based on the substantive plan (the plan as understood by the employer and plan members) and include the types of benefits provided at the time of each valuation and the historical pattern of sharing of benefit costs between the employer and plan members to that point. The actuarial methods and assumptions used include techniques that are designed to reduce short-term volatility in actuarial accrued liabilities and the actuarial value of assets, consistent with the long-term perspective of the calculations.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">In the June 30, 20X2, actuarial valuation, the entry age actuarial cost method was used. The actuarial assumptions included a 7.5 percent investment rate of return (net of administrative expenses) and an annual healthcare cost trend rate of 12 percent initially, reduced by decrements to an ultimate rate of 5 percent after 10 years. Both rates include a 4.5 percent inflation assumption. The actuarial value of PSPP assets was determined using techniques that spread the effects of short-term volatility in the market value of investments over a three-year period. PSPP&#39;s unfunded actuarial accrued liability is being amortized as a level percentage of projected payroll on a closed basis. The remaining amortization period at June 30, 20X2, was 22 years.</div></body></html>
