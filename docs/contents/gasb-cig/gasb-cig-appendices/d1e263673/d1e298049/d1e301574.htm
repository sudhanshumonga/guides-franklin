Total assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenditures/ expenses are shown for each fund. In addition, totals and percentages (10%) for all governmental funds and all enterprise funds are presented, as well as the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">combined</b> totals and percentages (5%) for all governmental and enterprise funds. The shaded amounts indicate that the first step in the test-the 10% criterion-has been met. The far-right column discloses whether the fund qualified as a major fund based on <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">both</b> the 10% and 5% comparisons.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Among governmental funds, only 3—SR7, SR8, and CPF3—meet the initial 10% criterion. SR7 and SR8 both have total <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">liabilities</b> in excess of the 10% benchmark ($3,267,159). CPF3 exceeds the 10% criterion for <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">assets</b> ($15,169,449). SR8, however, is not required to be reported as a major fund because it does not meet the second criterion. Its total liabilities of $6,513,754 do not exceed the 5% governmental and enterprise funds combined cutoff amount ($8,715,826). Similarly, CPF3&#39;s total assets of $21,321,620 fall short of the 5% mark ($26,772,076), and therefore that fund is also not required to be reported as a major fund.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Only SR7, with total liabilities of $12,829,985 that exceed <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">both</b> the 10% criterion ($3,267,159) <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">and</b> the 5% criterion ($8,715,826), is required to be reported as a major fund in the governmental fund financial statements. Those statements would present, at a minimum, four columns-the general fund, SR7, all other governmental funds, and a total governmental funds column.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">All enterprise funds except ENT3 and ENT4 have at least one element that exceeds <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">both</b> the 10% and 5% benchmarks and would be shown in separate columns in the proprietary fund financial statements as major funds.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">As demonstrated above, some funds will meet the first criterion (10%) but not meet the second (5%). Nevertheless, preparers should not bypass the first step of the test. Some funds will exceed the 5% requirement but not meet the first 10% benchmark. For example, the Debt Service Fund&#39;s expenditures meet the 5% criterion but fail the initial 10% test. Similarly, ENT4&#39;s liabilities exceed the 5% cutoff but do not meet the 10% criterion. Thus, neither the Debt Service Fund nor ENT4 is required to be reported as a major fund.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_118" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> (<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div></body></html>
