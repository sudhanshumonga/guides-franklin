Financial statements for major funds and financial information for major component units are required to be separately reported in the basic financial statements. Even though the separate reporting requirements of major component units and major funds appear to be similar, the criteria used to determine major funds differ from the considerations involved in selecting major component units, and there are other important differences—for example:</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">•<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#focus_on_major_funds_rec1">Paragraph 75</span> of Statement 34 requires governments to present each major <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fund</b> in a separate column in the appropriate fund financial statements.
