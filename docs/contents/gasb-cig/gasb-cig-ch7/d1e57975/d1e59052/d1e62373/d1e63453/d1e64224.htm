Provided that revenue recognition criteria pertaining to the donation have been met, would both the donation and the government&#39;s $1 million match be reported as restricted net position?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. The government voluntarily matches the $1 million donation in order to obtain the donation. Ordinarily, a voluntary limitation would not result in restricted net position. However, once the government obtains the donation, its own $1 million match becomes bound by the restriction imposed by the donor. Were the government to spend any portion of its matching amount, the terms of the donation would be violated and the government would have to return the money it received from the donor. Therefore, the entire $2 million corpus of the permanent fund would be reported as restricted net position.</div></body></html>
