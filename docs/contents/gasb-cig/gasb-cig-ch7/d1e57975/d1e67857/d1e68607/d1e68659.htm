The commissions and charges for other services provided are accounted for in a separate fund and, according to state statute, can only be used to provide benefits to the inmates. Expenditures include uniforms, meals, medical care, and construction and maintenance of a law library and video visitation center. Should the fund be classified as a private-purpose trust fund?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Even though the purpose of the fund seems to be to &quot;benefit individuals,&quot; the benefits are not specific benefits for specific individuals, but rather are in the context of the county&#39;s responsibility for prisoner care and welfare—in effect, the funds serve to reduce the amount of resources the county would otherwise have to raise to pay for those expenditures. The benefits are part of the &quot;corrections&quot; function and are for the inmate population in general, not for individuals. If a separate fund is reported, it should be a special revenue fund.</div></body></html>
