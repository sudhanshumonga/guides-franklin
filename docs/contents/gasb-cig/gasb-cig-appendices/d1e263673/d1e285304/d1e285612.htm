The county board of commissioners appoints members of the boards of education for municipalities located within the county, but may remove members only for cause. The local boards of education select their own management and control their own day-to-day operations.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">State law gives the state legislature the responsibility for providing a uniform system of free public schools. Accordingly, the state grants the county the following budgetary authority:</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Local school boards submit their entire budget to the county commissioners.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The county commissioners make appropriations to the local boards of education for that portion of the budget that is to be funded by the county.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The county commissioners approve the local school boards&#39; budgets, which are then adopted by the local school boards.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•If the county board allocates funds specifically to certain purposes or functions, the local boards of education are permitted to change the appropriation for the intended program or purpose within certain limits.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Changes in the school budget resolution, whether increases or decreases to projects in (1) acquisition of land or (2) building acquisition and construction, require county commissioner approval.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The county may allocate part or all of each appropriation by purpose, function, or project.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The authority of the county is limited by a statutory requirement that the county provide adequate school facilities. However, the county has no authority over the administration of the construction. A local board of education has legal recourse if it feels that the county is not providing adequate facilities or is not fulfilling its statutory funding responsibilities. A clerk of court or a judge can order a county to increase its financial support of a local board of education.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The local board of education would be discretely presented as a component unit of the county. The county board of commissioners appoints the members of each local board of education and is able to impose its will through its budgetary authority, which grants the county approval authority over the entire budget and thus is not merely a compliance approval required as a condition to receive financial aid. In addition, the county commissioners have approval authority over the capital acquisitions of the local board of education.</div></body></html>
