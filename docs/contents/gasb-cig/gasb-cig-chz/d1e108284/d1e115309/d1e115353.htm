The agreement meets all of the aspects of the definition of a tax abatement, according to Statement 77, except that it does not involve taxes for which the business would otherwise be liable. Under the terms of the agreement, the business is allowed to retain 40 percent of the state sales tax collected from its customers in the new stores for the first 5 years of their operation. Those are taxes the business otherwise would remit to the state, but the taxes are being paid by the business’ customers. Do the requirements of Statement 77 apply to this agreement?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. Even though the taxes are the obligation of the customers and the business is acting solely as the remitter of the sales taxes, the state government forgoes tax revenues as a result of this agreement. Consequently, this agreement meets the definition of a tax abatement under Statement 77.</div></body></html>
