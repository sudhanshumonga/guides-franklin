The owners generally are not governments. Owners that pay the fee receive coverage that makes a limited dollar amount available for the cost of cleanup. The coverage is renewable annually by paying a fee. Although fees are not required to be actuarially determined, a statute requires the state to set a fee that &quot;maintains the financial condition of the fund.&quot;</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> The program is not a public entity risk pool, because participants generally are not governments.
