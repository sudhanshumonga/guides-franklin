The basic financial statements include two kinds of statements that present different views of the City:</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•The first two statements are <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">government-wide financial statements</b> that provide both <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">long-term</b> and <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">short-term</b> information about the City&#39;s <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">overall</b> financial status.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The remaining statements are <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fund financial statements</b> that focus on <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">individual parts</b> of the City government, reporting the City&#39;s operations in <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">more detail</b> than the government-wide statements.</div><div class="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–The <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">governmental funds</b> statements tell how <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">general government</b> services like public safety were financed in the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">short term</b> as well as what remains for future spending.</div><div class="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Proprietary fund</b> statements offer <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">short-</b> and <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">long-term</b> financial information about the activities the government operates <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">like businesses,</b> such as the water and sewer system.</div><div class="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Fiduciary fund</b> statements provide information about the financial relationships—like the retirement plan for the City&#39;s employees—in which the City acts solely as a trustee or agent for the benefit of others, to whom the resources in question belong.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The basic financial statements also include <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">notes</b> that explain some of the information in the financial statements and provide more detailed data. The basic financial statements are followed by a section of <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">RSI</b> that further explains and supports the information in the financial statements. Figure A-1 shows how the required parts of this annual report are arranged and relate to one another. In addition to these required elements, we have included a section with combining statements that provide details about our nonmajor governmental funds and internal service funds, each of which are added together and presented in single columns in the basic financial statements.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_42" class="cd_online_ object_link image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> (<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the &quot;Document&quot; tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> Figure A-2 summarizes the major features of the City&#39;s financial statements, including the portion of the City government they cover and the types of information they contain. The remainder of this overview section of management&#39;s discussion and analysis explains the structure and contents of each of the statements.</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Government-Wide Statements</b> </div><div class="keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab">The government-wide statements report information about the City as a whole using accounting methods similar to those used by private-sector companies. The statement of net position includes <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">all</b> of the government&#39;s assets and liabilities. All of the current year&#39;s revenues and expenses are accounted for in the statement of activities regardless of when cash is received or paid.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The two government-wide statements report the City&#39;s <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">net position</b> and how it has changed. Net position—the difference between the City&#39;s assets and deferred outflows of resources and liabilities and deferred inflows of resources—is one way to measure the City&#39;s financial health, or <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">position</b>.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Over time, increases or decreases in the City&#39;s net position are an indicator of whether its financial health is improving or deteriorating, respectively.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•To assess the overall health of the City you need to consider additional nonfinancial factors such as changes in the City&#39;s property tax base and the condition of the City&#39;s roads.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The government-wide financial statements of the City are divided into three categories:</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Governmental activities</b>—Most of the City&#39;s basic services are included here, such as the police, fire, public works, and parks departments, and general administration. Property taxes and state and federal grants finance most of these activities.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Business-type activities</b>—The City charges fees to customers to help it cover the costs of certain services it provides. The City&#39;s water and sewer system and parking facilities are included here.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Component units</b>—The City includes two other entities in its report—the Sample City Public School District and the Sample City Landfill. Although legally separate, these &quot;component units&quot; are important because the City is financially accountable for them.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Fund Financial Statements</b> </div><div class="keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab">The fund financial statements provide more detailed information about the City&#39;s most significant <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">funds</b>—not the City as a whole. Funds are accounting devices that the City uses to keep track of specific sources of funding and spending for particular purposes.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Some funds are required by State law and by bond covenants.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The City Council establishes other funds to control and manage money for particular purposes (like the Route 7 construction project) or to show that it is properly using certain taxes and grants (like aid from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development).</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The City has three kinds of funds:</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Governmental funds</b>—Most of the City&#39;s basic services are included in governmental funds, which focus on (1) how <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">cash and other financial assets</b> that can readily be converted to cash flow in and out and (2) the balances left at year-end that are available for spending. Consequently, the governmental funds statements provide a detailed <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">short-term </b>view that helps you determine whether there are more or fewer financial resources that can be spent in the near future to finance the City&#39;s programs. Because this information does not encompass the additional long-term focus of the government-wide statements, we provide additional information at the bottom of the governmental funds statement, or on the subsequent page, that explains the relationship (or differences) between them.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Proprietary funds</b>—Services for which the City charges customers a fee are generally reported in proprietary funds. Proprietary funds, like the government-wide statements, provide both long- and short-term financial information.</div><div class="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–In fact, the City&#39;s enterprise funds (one type of proprietary fund) are the same as its business-type activities, but provide more detail and additional information, such as cash flows.</div><div class="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–We use internal service funds (the other kind of proprietary fund) to report activities that provide supplies and services for the City&#39;s other programs and activities—such as the City&#39;s Telecommunications Fund.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Fiduciary funds</b>—The City is the trustee, or <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fiduciary,</b> for its employees&#39; pension plans. It is also responsible for other assets that—because of a trust arrangement—can be used only for the trust beneficiaries. The City is responsible for ensuring that the assets reported in these funds are used for their intended purposes. All of the City&#39;s fiduciary activities are reported in a separate statement of fiduciary net position and a statement of changes in fiduciary net position. We exclude these activities from the City&#39;s government-wide financial statements because the City cannot use these assets to finance its operations.</div></body></html>
