Similarly, Employer B’s proportion would be 23/36, calculated as its direct contribution requirement of $7 million plus the state’s contribution of $16 million associated with Employer B, divided by total contributions from the employers and the state of $36 million ($5 million + $7 million + $24 million).</div></body></html>
