Some of the methods in paragraph 15 for disclosing interest rate risk may incorporate sufficient information required of highly sensitive investments so that additional disclosures may not be required. A disclosure that describes the effects of interest rate changes on aggregate portfolio values in both increasing and decreasing interest rate assumptions may include many, if not all, of the investment terms that <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._16" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._16">paragraph 16</span> of Statement 40, as amended, would require to be disclosed.

Specific additional disclosures that should be reported for highly sensitive investments when a simulation model is used to disclose interest rate risk have not been prescribed.</div></body></html>
