One example is an irrevocable bank letter of credit that supports share value when the fair value of the pool&#39;s investments is affected. An insurance policy would be a similar guarantee. Also, some pool sponsors may state a guaranteed share value. However, paragraph 71 indicates that to meet the requirements of Statement 31, the guarantee would have to be a stated legal obligation and be evaluated in light of the creditworthiness of the pool sponsor. Also, the fair value of the investments in the pool supplemented by the amount of the guarantee would have to fully support the share price. If the guarantee is a wrap contract associated with a synthetic guaranteed investment contract (SGIC), the provisions of paragraphs <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.20">20</span> and <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_synthetic_guaranteed_investment_contracts">67</span> of Statement 53 should be applied.</div></body></html>
