The state appoints all the members of the authority’s board and has pledged portions of its sales and motor fuel taxes to repay all of the outstanding debt of the authority. How should the financing authority be included in the state’s financial reporting entity? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The financing authority should be included as a blended component unit. Even though the authority provides financing services to entities other than the state, the fact that the authority’s debt is to be repaid entirely with resources of the state meets the criteria for blending in paragraph 53c of Statement 14, as amended. </div></body></html>
