For example, a state treasurer may maintain individual investment accounts for the municipal governments in the state. Specific investments are acquired for the individual municipalities, and the income from and changes in the value of those investments affect only the municipality for which they were acquired. Sometimes, such individual accounts are offered as an alternative to the sponsoring government&#39;s external investment pool; in other cases, only individual investment accounts are provided.</div></body></html>
