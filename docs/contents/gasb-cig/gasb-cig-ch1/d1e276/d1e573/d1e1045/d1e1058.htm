An investment policy may be formally adopted through legal or contractual provisions or by other means, usually by the governing board. However, a government&#39;s informal policies or general investment practices are not a required disclosure. For these policies and practices, the government would disclose that no policy had been adopted if a required disclosure was applicable. For example, historically, an airport authority has invested in securities rated in the top category of credit risk as issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). The airport authority is not required by an investment policy to invest in top-rated securities but has been doing so for the past 10 years absent any investment policy. In this case, the authority would disclose that no credit risk policy has been adopted.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._5">Paragraph 6</span> of Statement 40 indicates that only brief disclosures are required and a government should not include all details of its investment policies in its disclosures. Many investment policies are extremely long and can be quite detailed. If broad cash management and investment policies have been adopted, only a brief description of the policy that is related to the risks discussed in Statement 40 should be disclosed.</div></body></html>
