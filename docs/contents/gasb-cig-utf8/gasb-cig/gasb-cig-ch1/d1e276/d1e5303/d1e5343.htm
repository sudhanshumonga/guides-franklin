The term <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">accounting principle</b> includes not only accounting principles and practices but also the methods of applying them” (footnote omitted). Similar to a government using different methods to disclose interest rate risk among its various investment portfolios or funds within the same year, a government may choose to present different interest rate risk disclosures from year to year. To be consistent with its own management practices, a government may need to adopt a different method of reporting interest rate risk in subsequent years to accommodate a change in management, to accommodate a change in portfolio composition, or for other varying reasons. Any government choosing to change interest rate risk disclosure methods also should disclose the nature and reason for the change in accordance with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasb_op_gasb_62_par__75" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb_op_gasb_62_par__75">paragraph 75</span> of Statement 62.</div></body></html>
