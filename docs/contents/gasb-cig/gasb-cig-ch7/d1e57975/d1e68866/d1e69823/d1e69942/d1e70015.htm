The participating government&#39;s total equity interest should be calculated in accordance with the joint venture agreement. The amount that should be reported in the governmental fund, however, should be limited to amounts appropriately reported under the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Amounts reported in the governmental fund balance sheet may include, for example, an amount payable to, or receivable from, the joint venture. The governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances should report changes in joint venture equity interests only to the extent that the amounts received or receivable from the joint venture or the amounts paid or payable to the joint venture satisfy the revenue or expenditure recognition criteria for governmental funds. The entire equity interest in a joint venture should be reported in the government-wide statement of net position.
