Where should those explanations be presented—on the face of the fund financial statements, in accompanying schedules, or in the notes to the financial statements? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—For readability, the reconciling items presented on the face of the fund financial statements should be aggregated and the explanations of them should be brief. Lengthy explanations would not be appropriate on the face of the statements. If the reconciliation is presented on a separate page as a continuation of the financial statement, more space is certainly available to accommodate expanded explanations and, therefore, may be sufficient. Generally, the most suitable location for in-depth explanations of the items in the reconciliations would be in the notes to the financial statements. <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_appendix_7-2_illustrations-of-notes_rec1">Exhibit 10</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B7-2 illustrates two possible approaches that governments might use in the notes to provide in-depth explanations of the items in the fund-to-government-wide-statement reconciliations. </div></body></html>
