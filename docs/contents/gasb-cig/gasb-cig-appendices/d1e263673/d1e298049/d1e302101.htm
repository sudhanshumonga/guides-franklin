There are a number of price-level indexes that may be used, both private- and public-sector, to remove the effects of price-level changes from current prices. Accumulated depreciation would be calculated based on the deflated amount, except for general infrastructure assets reported according to the modified approach.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Allowing the use of current replacement cost and adjusting for price-level changes back to an asset&#39;s acquisition year was a technique the Board used to reduce the costs and effort of implementing Statement 34.

This Statement permits initial capitalization using deflated current replacement cost, which in the Board&#39;s judgment represents estimated historical cost. The Statement indicates that bond documents and capital budgets may be consulted as source documents for estimated historical cost. All governments are permitted deferred implementation. Required capitalization is limited to major assets as defined by the Statement. The required retroactive capitalization period need not extend beyond years ending after June 30, 1980. Composite depreciation rates based on groupings of similar assets or classes of dissimilar assets are permitted.</div><div class="ps_centered_heading_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_centered_heading_1">* * *</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The purpose of this illustration is to demonstrate how historical cost may be estimated using current replacement cost deflated by a price-level change factor.</div><div class="ps_tertiary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_tertiary_heading">Summary of Facts</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•The county is focusing on recording its rural access road network at the transition date of June 30, 2003.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Current construction cost per lane-mile for a rural access road is approximately $500,000.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The county has elected to limit its transition capitalization to road projects that resulted in acquisition, construction, or significant reconstruction or improvement of county roads since June 30, 1980 (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._149">paragraph 149</span> of Statement 34).
