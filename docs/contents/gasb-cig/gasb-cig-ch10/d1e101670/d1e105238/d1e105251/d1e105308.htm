At issuance, the investment made by the initial investor does not qualify for the leveraged yield criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.64">paragraph 64c(5)</span> of Statement 53, as amended. Thus, the bond was not reported as a hybrid instrument by the government. The initial investor, however, later sells the bond in the secondary market. Due to current market prices, the embedded derivative in the bond now meets the leveraged yield criteria for the subsequent investor. Should the government now account for this bond as a hybrid instrument because it meets the leveraged yield criteria for the subsequent investor?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The leveraged yield criteria in paragraph 64c(5), as amended, should be assessed only at the date the hybrid instrument is issued or acquired.</div></body></html>
