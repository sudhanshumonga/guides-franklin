Is this bond considered an investment that is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. Because of factors described in Question 1.64.1, this investment's fair value may be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates. However, because such an investment's maturity information may have been disclosed in the basic interest rate risk disclosure (Statement 40, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._15" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._15">paragraph 15</span>), no additional disclosure as a highly sensitive investment may be required. The magnitude of price fluctuations experienced by debt investments as a result of interest rate changes varies dramatically between short-term and long-term maturities. The longer it takes for a debt investment to mature, the more fair value will decline when interest rates increase because the holder is subject to the lower coupon rate for a longer period of time. There is a large difference between the fair value fluctuations of debt investments that mature in one or two years versus debt investments that may mature in 15 years or more. For example, if interest rates rise from 6 to 7 percent, a 6 percent coupon bond with one year remaining to maturity will theoretically lose 1 percent of its fair value. However, a bond with a 6 percent coupon maturing in 20 years will theoretically see a drop in its fair value by approximately 10 percent. Hence, the fair value of long-term debt investments tends to be more sensitive to interest rate changes than the fair value of short-term debt investments.</div></body></html>
