Impairment of an intangible asset often will be indicated by a change in duration of use of the asset. One means by which this can occur is through a change in the manner or duration of use of an associated tangible asset. For example, a government’s rights to capacity at a water treatment plant may experience a change in duration of use if a decision is made to shut down the plant earlier than originally expected. A change in duration of use of an intangible asset also may occur if there are changes in the terms or status of the contract from which the asset is created, for example, if the length of a government’s contract for water rights is renegotiated from 40 to 20 years. A change from an indefinite useful life to a finite useful life, for example, in the case of a government that, because of environmental concerns, intends by a future date to cease using land use rights that were acquired under a contract with an unlimited term, also is considered a change in duration of use. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Impairment of an intangible asset may be indicated by evidence of obsolescence, for example, in the case of computer software or a patent for which new technology has limited its usefulness. Impairment also may be indicated by the enactment or approval of laws or regulations or other changes in environmental factors, for example, a change in patent law that affects the legal rights of patent holders. An indication that an internally generated intangible asset in development has been impaired is a stoppage in the development process. Such a stoppage may be the result of any number of events, including a change in the priorities of management in relation to the intangible asset or a change in view regarding the technological or technical feasibility of the project. </div></body></html>
