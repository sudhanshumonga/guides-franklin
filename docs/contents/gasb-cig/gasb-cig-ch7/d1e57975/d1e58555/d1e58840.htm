How might governments meet this requirement?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The primary objective of the requirement in paragraph 11a is to help readers of MD&amp;A understand the relationship of the results reported in the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">governmental funds</b> financial statements to the results reported for <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">governmental activities</b> in the government-wide statements. For example, if the statement of activities reports a significant decrease in the net position of governmental activities and the fund financial statements show an increase in the fund balances of the governmental funds, MD&amp;A should explain why that occurred. The explanation could be that significant bond proceeds were received and capital expenditures were unusually low in capital project funds, or that some long-term liabilities were reported in the government-wide statements that did not affect the governmental funds. The causes of differences should be evident in the reconciliations accompanying the fund financial statements (see <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#required_reconciliation_to_government-wide_statements_rec1">paragraph 77</span>), but MD&amp;A should provide an overview of that information, in narrative fashion, to meet the requirement of paragraph 11a. On the other hand, if the reasons for the change in net position of governmental activities and the change in fund balances of governmental funds are similar, MD&amp;A should note that similarity.</div></body></html>
