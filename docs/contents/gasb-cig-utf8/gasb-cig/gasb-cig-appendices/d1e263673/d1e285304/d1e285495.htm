The authority operates as a separate legal entity in accordance with state law. The authority board is made up of nine members. The board of county commissioners of each county included in the authority's service area appoints one board member. These board members appoint all other board members. The majority of the authority's operations are funded by the state and the federal government, with additional funding in the form of appropriations from counties, and sometimes cities, that are within its service area. The authority does not issue debt, although it is authorized to enter into lease-financing arrangements for the purchase of assets with the approval of the counties that appoint the governing board.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The authority selects its management and is responsible for its day-to-day operations. The state is not responsible for deficits of the authority, nor does it have access to the resources of the authority. The area authority determines its own budgets, subject to the approval of the state oversight agency. The state agency has the power to:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•Approve the authority's plans and budgets and adopt rules pertaining to the content and format of these plans and budgets</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Adopt rules governing the expenditure of all area authority funds</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Administer and enforce rules that are conditions of participation in federal and State financial aid programs.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The area mental health authority is not a component unit of the state. The state does not appoint a voting majority of the board of the authority. Although the state agency has the power to approve the budget of the authority, its role is compliance-oriented rather than substantive, which would not create fiscal dependency. In addition, the relationship between the state and the authority does not meet the criteria for inclusion under Statement 39. Therefore, the state would not include the authority in its reporting entity.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The authority would be reported as a joint venture (without equity interest) or as a jointly governed organization by the participating (appointing) counties, depending on whether the annual appropriations to the authority constitute an ongoing financial responsibility, as defined in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#ongoing_financial_responsibility_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-op#ongoing_financial_responsibility_rec1">paragraph 71</span> of Statement 14. A participating government has an ongoing financial responsibility if the organization's continued existence depends on continued funding by the government.</div></body></html>
