Specifically, they illustrate circumstances in which the measure of payroll on which actual contributions are determined differs from the measure of payroll on which actuarially determined contribution rates are calculated.</div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Example A</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">As a result of an actuarial valuation, both the plan (single-employer plan with the same fiscal year-end as the employer) and the employer are notified that the actuarially determined contribution for the coming year is 15 percent of covered payroll. The calculation of the actuarially determined contribution rate was based on a projected covered payroll of $2.0 million for the year to which the actuarially determined contribution will apply. The employer is legally required to contribute to the plan an amount equal to the actuarially determined contribution rate applied to the actual covered payroll, rather than the projected covered payroll. The actual covered payroll for the year is $2.1 million. By year-end, the plan has recognized (on the accrual basis) $315,000 of employer contributions (that is, $2,100,000 × 0.15).</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">To ensure an appropriate comparison of actuarially determined contributions to contributions received (on the accrual basis), the information in the plan’s schedule of contribution-related information should be on the same measure of payroll. In this example, the plan should report $315,000 (the actual covered payroll for the year times the actuarially determined contribution rate) as the actuarially determined contribution for the year. Actual amounts should be equal to those recognized by the pension plan in relation to the actuarially determined contribution (in this case, $315,000). Thus, the amounts presented in the most recent year of the plan’s schedule of contribution-related information should be the following:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Example B</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">As in Example A, the actuarially determined contribution rate is 15 percent of covered payroll, based on a projected covered payroll of $2.0 million. The actual covered payroll for the current year is $2.1 million. In contrast to Example A, however, the employer is legally required to contribute to the plan at a statutory rate of 10 percent of actual covered payroll. Therefore, the employer’s statutorily required contributions for the year are $210,000 ($2,100,000 × 0.10). This is the amount that the plan recognizes as an addition to fiduciary net position from employer contributions in its statement of changes in fiduciary net position for the year. The amounts presented in the most recent year of the plan’s schedule of contribution-related information should be the following:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Example C</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">If in Example B, the employer was required to contribute based on projected covered payroll instead of actual covered payroll, the amount recognized by the plan as employer contributions in its statement of changes in fiduciary net position would be $200,000 ($2,000,000 × 0.10), and the amounts presented in the most recent year of the plan’s schedule of contribution-related information should be the following:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div></body></html>
