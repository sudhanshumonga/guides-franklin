The latter column would be referred to as the &quot;original amount levied&quot; or &quot;original tax levy.&quot; If this approach is used, a &quot;total adjusted levy&quot; column should be added that sums the original levy and the subsequent adjustments. (For an example, see <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_B-8">Exhibit B-8</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B9-2.)</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The percentage of the levy collected within the period of the levy should continue to be calculated as (amount collected within the period of the levy ÷ original amount levied for the period). However, the total collections percentage would be calculated as (total collections to date ÷ total adjusted levy), rather than as a percentage of the original levy.</div></body></html>
