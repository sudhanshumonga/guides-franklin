However, the footnote limits the classification of risk financing activities by stand-alone entities that are not reported as component units. Stand-alone entities that are engaged only in business-type or fiduciary activities and that are not considered to be a part of another financial reporting entity should not use an internal service fund to report their own risk financing activities. Instead, their risk financing activities should be reported as part of the stand-alone entities’ activities. Business-type or fiduciary component units should not use an internal service fund of their own to report their risk financing activities. However, those component units may use the risk financing internal service fund of the primary government.</div></body></html>
