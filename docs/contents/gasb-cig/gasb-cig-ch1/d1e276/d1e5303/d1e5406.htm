Governments may choose among the interest rate risk disclosure alternatives provided in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._15">paragraph 15</span> of Statement 40 so that their disclosure methods are consistent with the way the government identifies and manages interest rate risk. A government may manage its overall interest rate risk by separately identifying the interest rate risk associated with different maturity investments. Investments with interest rates that are fixed for longer periods of time are likely to be subject to more variability in their fair values as a result of future changes in interest rates. To better manage this risk, a government may, for example, choose a more sophisticated method of measuring interest rate risk and may therefore have the information available to disclose that risk using a more complex disclosure model. Allowing a government to report interest rate risk using different methods based on the terms of the investments will enable the government to better align its disclosures with its management practices.</div></body></html>
