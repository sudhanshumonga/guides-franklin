However, this type of schedule (see <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_D-21">Exhibit D-21</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B9-2) commonly has been presented by school districts for many years and is valued by financial report users. In addition to this schedule, or in lieu of it, a school district may choose to report information about school buildings and administrative facilities in the aggregate, as well as information about other capital assets, such as school buses, athletic facilities, and equipment.
