In 20X4, one business participated in the program and received an income tax credit equal to 30 percent of its corporate income tax liability. A law in the state where the government is located prohibits the public disclosure of aggregated tax information if the information relates directly or indirectly to a taxpayer’s income or earnings. How would the government meet the requirements of Statement 77 in light of this legal prohibition?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The government should disclose whatever information is not specifically prohibited by the state law. For instance, if disclosing the gross amount of the tax revenues that were reduced as a result of this tax abatement agreement (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs77_par_7">paragraph 7b</span> of Statement 77) violates the state law as it relates to the single business participating in the program, the government may omit that amount but should disclose all of the other information required by paragraph 7 of Statement 77. The government also should disclose what type of information it omitted and cite the state law that prohibits its disclosure. </div></body></html>
