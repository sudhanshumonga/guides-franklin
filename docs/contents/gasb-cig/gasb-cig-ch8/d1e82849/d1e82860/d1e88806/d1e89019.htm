Often, required information will include data related to employment status, gender, birth date, hire date, and date of retirement (if applicable) for each current plan member. In addition, if benefits are provided to spouses or dependents, information about the marital status and dependency status of the plan member, as well as information related to the gender and dates of birth of spouses or dependents, likely would be required. Also, information on which to base assumptions about the point in time at which active members are expected to begin receiving benefits (for example, the average age at retirement for past retirees) and the probability of a member&#39;s qualifying for benefits (turnover data by age) generally would be needed.</div></body></html>
