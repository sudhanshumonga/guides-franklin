The county uses an agency fund as a distribution mechanism for the taxes. At year-end, the collector is holding $3,450,000 in the tax distribution account. Of that total, $750,000 will be distributed to the county funds, and the remaining $2,700,000 represents taxes collected for the other taxing bodies in the county. How does the county apply the &quot;clearing account&quot; provision in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._111">paragraph 111</span> of Statement 34 for agency funds? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—In the county&#39;s financial statements, the tax collector&#39;s agency fund would report only the $2,700,000 in cash with an equal amount as a liability to other taxing bodies. The $750,000 collected and on hand for the county&#39;s funds would be reported as cash (rather than taxes receivable or due from agency funds) in the appropriate funds. In essence, the collector has a &quot;pooled&quot; cash account, similar to an internal investment pool. The allocation of cash balances to the county funds is consistent with the requirement in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs31_par._14">paragraph 14</span> of Statement 31 that requires the &quot;equity position&quot; of each fund in an internal investment pool to be reported as assets in those funds.</div></body></html>
