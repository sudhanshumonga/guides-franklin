A permanent right-of-way easement is an example of an intangible asset that normally should be considered to have an indefinite useful life. An intangible asset should not be considered to have an indefinite useful life solely because the precise length of the period over which it will provide service (that is, its useful life) is unknown. For example, the precise length of the useful life of computer software may not be known; however, it is known that the software will become obsolete and need to be replaced at some future point—in other words, its useful life is limited or finite. This also is the case for most tangible capital assets because they eventually will become physically deteriorated, although the exact point at which they will cease providing service is unknown. A capital asset of this nature, whether tangible or intangible, should be depreciated or amortized over an estimate of its useful life. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_68">Question 7.14.1</span> about how the useful life of capital assets, including intangible assets, may be estimated.)</div></body></html>
