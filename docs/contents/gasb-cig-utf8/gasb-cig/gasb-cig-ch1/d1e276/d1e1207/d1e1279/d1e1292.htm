The objective of the disclosure is to give users basic information about the government's investment environment and its potential risk.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The disclosure can include a citation of the legal provisions that list authorized investments, but that should not be the only information provided. On the other hand, users should not be given needless detail. If the list of investment types authorized by legal or contractual provisions is long and detailed, appropriate summary information could be given. For instance, a state law listing permissible investments may be several pages long, including, for example, the specific U.S. agency obligations in which local governments may invest. In this situation, the note disclosure might summarize these authorized investments as "various U.S. agency obligations."</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If legal provisions require only that investments be selected on the basis of a prudent-person or prudent-expert rule, only that information need be disclosed. That is, the government does not need to disclose the types of investments it selects in adherence with the prudent-person rule, unless another legal requirement requires the use of specific investment types.</div></body></html>
