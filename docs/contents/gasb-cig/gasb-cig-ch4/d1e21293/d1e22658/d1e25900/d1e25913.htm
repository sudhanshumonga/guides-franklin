However, if the government purchases the corporation primarily for the purpose of income or profit and its present service capacity is based solely on its ability to generate cash (or to be sold to generate cash), the government should account for its equity interest ownership in the corporation as an investment. If the acquisition meets the definition of an investment, it should be measured in conformity with the provisions of paragraphs 77 and 78 of Statement 72.</div></body></html>
