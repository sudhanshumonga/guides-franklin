The foundation has a history of supporting the library with a majority of the financial resources it raises. Throughout the year, the library requests funding from the foundation to support various projects. The resources distributed to the library in any single year may or may not be significant, but the resources held by the foundation are significant to the library.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>ABC Library Foundation is a component unit of ABC Public Library and should be discretely presented in ABC Public Library&#39;s reporting entity financial statements. The foundation&#39;s resources are almost entirely for the benefit of ABC Public Library and the &quot;entitlement/ability to access&quot; criterion is met because the foundation has a history of supporting the library with its economic resources. Finally, the resources received or held by the foundation that the library is entitled to are significant to the library.</div></body></html>
