Through an intergovernmental agreement between the service district and the city, the commission is responsible for operation and management of three city-owned sports facilities, including all food service operations. The commission owns all of the food service equipment used in the facilities. Under the agreement, the city retains the title to the sports facilities and remains obligated to pay certain debt related to those facilities.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The commission and the city each have an undivided interest in the operation of the facilities.
