The county has sold the naming rights for the facility to a locally based national corporation. The agreement calls for the corporation to make annual payments to the county for the next 10 years. The county has the opportunity to receive a lump-sum payment this year from an outside party for the naming rights revenues. Does the county maintain an active involvement in the generation of the naming rights revenue? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The fundamental or primary activity that generates revenues from the sale of public facility <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">naming rights</b> is affixing a specific name on specific facilities. Even though a naming rights agreement may contemplate or assume certain other activities, in this instance, those activities, per se, do not generate the naming rights revenue. They may generate revenues on their own (a contract with a professional sports team and the revenue it generates, for example), and if the cash flows from those revenues were &quot;sold,&quot; one would conclude that the government remains actively involved in their generation. However, those revenues are not the subject of the sale of the cash flows in this agreement. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs48_par_9">Paragraph 9</span> of Statement 48 states that active involvement generally requires a substantive action or performance. Because affixing a name to a facility does not constitute an ongoing substantive action or performance, the county does not remain actively involved in the primary activity that generates naming rights revenues. The transaction would be reported as a sale of future revenues if the other criteria in paragraphs 8b–8e of Statement 48 also are met. If those criteria are met, the proceeds from the sale would be reported as a deferred inflow of resources and recognized as revenue over the 10-year term of the agreement, as required by <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs48_par_14">paragraph 14</span> of Statement 48, as amended. Because all naming rights contracts do not include the same terms, obligations, or conditions, each agreement should be examined to determine whether different contract provisions should lead to a different conclusion about active involvement. </div></body></html>
