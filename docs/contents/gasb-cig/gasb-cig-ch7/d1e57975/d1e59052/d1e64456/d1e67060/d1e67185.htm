The federal reimbursement should be reported as program revenue of the function that includes the agency (the subrecipient) that reports the reimbursed expenses in the statement of activities. For parallel accounting in the governmental funds, the “passing through” from one agency to another should be accounted for consistent with a reimbursement. That is, the lead agency would reduce its revenue by the amount transferred to the subrecipient agency, rather than report the amount as revenue and a transfer.</div></body></html>
