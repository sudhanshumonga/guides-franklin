(See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_financial_accountability_rec1">Question 4.17.1</span> for further discussion of appointments.) However, the primary government is not financially accountable because it cannot impose its will on the organization and a financial benefit/burden relationship does not exist. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">For example, a port authority was established by the city for the purpose of stimulating commerce and promoting the shipment of goods and cargoes. Its governing board consists of five members appointed by the mayor of the city; however, the city does not appoint the port authority’s management. The board members may not be removed except for cause. The port authority determines the budget, issues bonded debt, levies taxes, and sets its rates without the approval of the city. The port authority does not provide a financial benefit, nor does it impose a financial burden on the city. Because the city is unable to impose its will on the authority and there is no financial burden or benefit relationship between the city and the authority, the port authority is not a component unit of the city. However, because the city appoints the voting majority of the authority’s board, the port authority should be disclosed as a related organization.</div></body></html>
