The transfer agreement requires the housing authority to remit to the transferee the cash collected from the mortgage payments with the provision that the housing authority would cover delinquencies, if any. Does that provision cause the transaction to be recognized as a borrowing rather than a sale pursuant to the criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs48_par_7">paragraph 7b(1) of Statement 48</span>? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Paragraph 7b(1) states that the transferor should have no obligation to advance amounts to the transferee before it collects equivalent amounts from the underlying accounts. That criterion is intended to address situations in which the transferor would be required to advance the entire amount due to the transferee before the payments are collected from the underlying mortgages. The provision in the agreement in this example is, in substance, a recourse provision, rather than a requirement to advance payment to the transferee. Paragraphs <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs48_par_38">38</span> and <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs48_par_40">40</span> in the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 48 discuss why obligations that arise from recourse or reacquisition provisions do not preclude recognition of a transfer transaction as a sale.</div></body></html>
