The state also enters into tax abatement agreements with companies that allow the companies to retain a portion of the gas taxes they collect in return for installing safer and more ecologically sensitive equipment. Those tax abatements reduce the amount of gas tax revenue that the state receives, and therefore, the amount that the state shares with local governments also is reduced. Assuming that the agreements otherwise qualify as a tax abatement under Statement 77, are both the state and local governments required to disclose information about these tax abatements?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The state government would disclose information about those tax abatements because its gas tax revenues have been reduced. However, the local governments would not disclose information about the tax abatement agreements because the local government revenue that is reduced is shared revenue, which is not considered to be tax revenue.
