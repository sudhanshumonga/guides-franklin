Information about those five agreements should be disclosed. If the tax abatement agreements for the three major programs are reported in the aggregate for each program, the remaining five tax abatement agreements should be reported in the aggregate. If, however, a government applies a quantitative threshold to disclose individually some or all of the tax abatement agreements in the three major programs, the same quantitative threshold should be applied to the remaining five tax abatement agreements.</div></body></html>
