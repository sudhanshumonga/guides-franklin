It provides that an employer that hires a disabled worker will not, in the event such worker suffers a subsequent injury on the job, be held liable for a disability that had actually occurred before this employment. That is, it ensures that the employer pays only the benefits that are due for the second injury. Other than an initial contribution to the fund, the state is not responsible for the fund&#39;s financing, which consists of assessments to all workers&#39; compensation insurance carriers and self-insured employers. These are primarily nongovernmental employers. Assessments are based on a percentage of prior-year claims paid.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> The fund is more in the nature of a state benefit program than a pool: Participants are primarily nongovernmental, and there is no transfer of risk. In this example, the state is not liable for the fund&#39;s financing after an initial contribution. If the state were liable, however, Statement 10, as amended, should be applied to the recognition and measurement of claims liabilities that are required to be paid by the state from resources other than the assessments. Those requirements begin with paragraph 52 of Statement 10, as amended, for entities other than pools.</div></body></html>
