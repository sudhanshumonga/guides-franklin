If the primary purpose of the intangible asset is to be used in operations, then the asset should be considered within the scope of Statement 51. If the primary purpose of the intangible asset is to directly obtain income or profit, then the asset would meet the scope exclusion in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs51_par__3">paragraph 3a</span> of Statement 51 and, therefore, would not be subject to the provisions of the Statement. To assist in determining the primary purpose of the intangible asset, a government in exercising professional judgment may consider the amount of revenue that the intangible asset is expected to generate in comparison to the expected level of service capacity to be provided through its use in operations. </div></body></html>
