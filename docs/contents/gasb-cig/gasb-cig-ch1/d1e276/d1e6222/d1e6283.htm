The limited partnership has investments in various countries. Do foreign currency risk disclosures “look through” the partnership to identify the foreign currency risks?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Consistent with the requirements established for external investment pools, no disclosure is required for the individual deposits or investments of the limited partnership. (See Question 1.3.8.) Consequently, a government holding an investment in a limited partnership would not be required to report the risks associated with the individual investments of the limited partnership. Disclosure of the fair value and type of investment is sufficient to acknowledge the government’s exposure to foreign currency risk. Disclosures related to fair value measurement also should be provided, consistent with the requirements of Statement 72. In contrast, in the case that an investment in a limited partnership is itself an investment in foreign currency investments, the disclosure requirements in paragraph 17 of Statement 40, in addition to the Statement 72 requirements, should be followed. For example, a government invests in a limited partnership that holds all of its investments (which are significant to the total assets of the limited partnership) in Japan. If exchange rates become significantly unfavorable, the financial viability of the limited partnership may be called into question. Consequently, the financial viability of the government’s investment in the limited partnership also may become questionable because of the foreign exchange risk attributable to Yen borne by the partnership.</div></body></html>
