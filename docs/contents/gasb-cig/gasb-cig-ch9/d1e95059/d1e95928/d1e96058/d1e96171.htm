For the purpose of determining its most significant own-source revenue, should the taxes be treated as separate revenue sources or as a single revenue source?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Governments tend to aggregate all of their ad valorem property taxes, even when separate levies with differential tax rates are applied to different kinds of property. Consequently, total property tax revenue is considered when determining if the property tax is a government&#39;s most significant own-source revenue. A single set of schedules could be prepared for the aggregate property tax, although different types of property would be identified in the revenue base and revenue rate schedules. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Alternatively, a government could treat the two property taxes separately, presenting revenue capacity schedules for one, both, or neither depending on how they compare with the government&#39;s other own-source revenues. Neither approach is required. A government should choose the approach that would be most meaningful to the users of its financial report.</div></body></html>
