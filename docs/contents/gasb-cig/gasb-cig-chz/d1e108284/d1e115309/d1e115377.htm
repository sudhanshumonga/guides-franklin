Under the terms of the agreement, the government will forgo all property taxes related to the office building and warehouse for a 10-year period, and the business will hire and maintain a workforce of at least 200 employees. The company begins construction in the summer of 20X1 but does not open the facility before the end of the year. The government abated property taxes of $21,000 for the fiscal year ended December 31, 20X1. Considering that the government has abated the taxes prior to the business fulfilling its requirements under the agreement, is the government required to disclose information about this tax abatement agreement in its financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 20X1?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. The definition of a tax abatement in Statement 77 requires that the agreement precede the performance of the required action by the individual or entity. However, the timing of the reduction in taxes in relation to the performance of the actions by the individual or entity is not relevant to determining whether an agreement meets the definition of a tax abatement for purposes of the Statement. The abatement of taxes may begin before or after the individual or entity has fulfilled its commitments under the agreement.</div></body></html>
