Duration methods can be calculated using analytical software.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Macaulay duration is a measurement of the weighted average term to maturity of a bond's cash flows whereby the weighting is based on the present value of each cash flow divided by the price.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Modified duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of a bond to interest rate movements. It is equal to the Macaulay duration divided by (1 + [bond yield / <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">k</b>]) where <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">k</b> is the number of compounding periods per year.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Effective duration is a method of disclosing interest rate risk that measures the expected change in value of a fixed-income security or portfolio for a given change in interest rates. Because effective duration makes assumptions regarding the most likely timing and amounts of variable cash flows, it is particularly useful for measuring interest rate risk of callable bonds, collateralized mortgage obligations, and other mortgage-backed securities.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Both modified duration and effective duration provide a measure of risk that changes proportionately with market rates. For example, if interest rates fell by 1 percent, the value of a security or portfolio having a modified or effective duration of 3.0 generally would increase in price by 3 percent. Duration methods can be calculated using analytical software.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Duration, as a measurement of the impact of interest rates on bond prices, is only an approximation. Effective duration tends to be a more accurate measure of interest rate risk when there are large changes in prevailing interest rates, unlike both Macaulay and modified duration whose error magnifies as the changes in prevailing rates get larger.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Whereas effective duration makes assumptions regarding the most likely timing and amounts of variable cash flows, Macaulay and modified duration do not take into account such variable cash flows. Some believe that neither modified duration nor Macaulay duration is accurate for debt investments or portfolios with call options, mortgage securities, or put options. Accordingly, effective duration, and similar variations, may need to be utilized when analyzing a bond portfolio consisting of bonds with call options, prepayment provisions, and any other variable cash flows to better gauge the effect of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the portfolio.</div></body></html>
