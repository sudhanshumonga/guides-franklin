Should the distinction between collateralized deposits exposed to custodial credit risk (Statement 40, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._8" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._8">paragraphs 8b and 8c</span>) and "uncollateralized" deposits (paragraph 8a) be made in the note disclosure?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—There is a fundamental difference in risk between deposits that are not collateralized and those that are, even though the collateral is held by the pledging financial institution, or by its trust department or agent but not in the government's name. (If an uninsured deposit is not collateralized, a government has no security in the event of default. If an uninsured deposit is collateralized, a government does have security against such a default, even though custodial arrangements may pose potential risk.) Therefore, even though all of these situations subject a government to custodial credit risk, a government's note disclosure should appropriately describe its particular situation.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">For example, if a government's deposits are not collateralized, the note disclosure should describe that deposits exposed to custodial credit risk are uncollateralized. If a government's deposits are collateralized but the custodial arrangements result in the deposits being exposed to custodial credit risk, the government should use language that describes that situation—for example, "collateralized with securities held by the pledging financial institution." For the note to describe this condition as uncollateralized could mislead the reader about the nature of the risk. If a government has some deposits that are uncollateralized and some that are collateralized but considered to have custodial credit risk because of the custodial arrangements, the government's description of custodial credit risk could indicate both conditions. See Illustration 8 in nonauthoritative Appendix B1-2 for an example disclosure.</div></body></html>
