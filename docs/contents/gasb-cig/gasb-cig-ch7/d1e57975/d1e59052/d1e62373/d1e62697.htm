The government&#39;s officials have determined that the enterprise fund will make the principal and interest payments on the bonds. On the government-wide statement of net position, would the government report governmental activities with debt but no asset, and business-type activities with the asset but no debt?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. NCGA Statement 1, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#long-term_liabilities_rec1">paragraph 42</span>, as amended, states that bonds, notes, and other long-term liabilities directly related to and expected to be paid from proprietary funds should be included in the accounts of such funds. Therefore, in this situation, the debt should be reported as enterprise fund (and consequently BTA) debt, because it is expected that the enterprise fund will repay the debt. If that were not the case, however, in the government-wide statement of net position, business-type activities would report an asset and no debt, and governmental activities would report debt and no asset. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_29">Question 7.7.6</span> for guidance about reclassifying the debt within a total column.) </div></body></html>
