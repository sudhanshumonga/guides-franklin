Repayment of the loan will commence in three years. The RDA is a component unit of the city and meets the criteria for blending. When the RDA is included in the city&#39;s financial reporting entity, the loan will be reported as an interfund receivable/payable. The RDA uses the governmental fund structure in its separately issued financial statements. In those statements, should the loan from the city be reported as a governmental fund liability to parallel the reporting of the RDA as a blended component unit? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Within the context of the separately issued financial statements of the RDA, the debt is not fund debt and should not be included in the fund financial statements because it is long-term external debt. It would, however, be reported as a liability in the RDA&#39;s government-wide statement of net position. When the financial data of the RDA are blended into the funds of the city, the amount due to the city becomes an internal advance and should be reported as a fund liability. In one setting (as a blended component unit) the debt is internal, but in the other (the RDA&#39;s separate financial statements) it is not. In the blending process, the liability to the city reported in the RDA’s government-wide statement of net position would not be carried over to the city’s statement of net position, and the fund balance of the RDA should be adjusted (reduced) to reflect the long-term internal payable to the city&#39;s general fund.</div></body></html>
