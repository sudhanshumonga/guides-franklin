The insurance internal service funds account for and finance the County&#39;s risks. Premiums are paid into the insurance funds by all other funds and are available to pay claims, claim reserves, and administrative costs of the program. The County purchases commercial insurance for risks related to injuries to employees. For all other risks of loss, the County has purchased an excess coverage insurance policy covering individual claims in excess of $1,000,000 and retains the risk of loss for individual claims below $1,000,000. Amounts of settlements have not exceeded insurance coverage in the past three years.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Liabilities are reported when it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Liabilities include an amount for claims that have been incurred but not reported (IBNRs). Claim liabilities are based upon the estimated ultimate cost of settling the claims, including specific, incremental claim adjustment expenses, salvage, and subrogation and considering the effects of inflation and recent claim settlement trends, including frequency and amount of payouts and other economic and social factors. The liability for claims and judgments is reported in the insurance funds.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Changes in the balances of claims liabilities during the last two years ended June 30, are as follows:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_134bm" class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div></body></html>
