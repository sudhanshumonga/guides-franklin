Identifying restricted cash equivalents that are similar to unrestricted cash equivalents as investments is acceptable according to the provisions of paragraph 11 of Statement 9. As long as an entity formulates and discloses a specific policy for defining cash equivalents, it may elect to treat any type of cash equivalents as investments. For example, Treasury bills with 60-day maturities in a restricted portfolio may be treated as investments even if unrestricted Treasury bills with the same maturities are treated as cash equivalents. (Paragraph 52 of the Statement 9 Basis for Conclusions states that "...governmental enterprises may choose to treat their restricted cash equivalents or unrestricted cash equivalents as investments.")</div></body></html>
