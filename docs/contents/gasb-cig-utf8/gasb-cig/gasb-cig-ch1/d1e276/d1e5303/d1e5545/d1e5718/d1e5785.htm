The simulation model is designed to estimate changes in an investment's or a portfolio's fair value, given hypothetical changes in interest rates. Many investments or portfolios illustrate adverse changes in fair values from increasing interest rates; however, governments may have investments or portfolios in which the opposite would be true. In these cases, governments using the simulation model would disclose the scenario in which a decrease in interest rates would adversely affect the instrument's or portfolio's fair value. The simulation model method of disclosing interest rate risk is designed to show how changes in interest rates will negatively affect an investment's or a portfolio's fair value.</div></body></html>
