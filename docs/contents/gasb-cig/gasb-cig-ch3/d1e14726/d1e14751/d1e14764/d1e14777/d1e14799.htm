Paragraphs 10-12 of Statement 10 define a public entity risk pool as:</div><div class="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1">a cooperative group of governmental entities joining together to finance an exposure, liability, or risk. Risk may include property and liability, workers’ compensation, or employee health care. A pool may be a stand-alone entity or be included as part of [another] governmental entity that acts as the pool’s sponsor.</div><div class="ps_cqa_quoted_material_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_quoted_material_2">A governmental entity that is a pool’s sponsor may also participate in the pool for its own risk management function. . . .</div><div class="ps_cqa_quoted_material_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_quoted_material_2">Stand-alone pools are established under authorizing statute by agreement of any number of state and local governmental entities. Stand-alone pools are sometimes organized or sponsored by municipal leagues, school associations, or other types of associations of governmental entities. A stand-alone pool is frequently operated by a board that has as its membership one member from each participating government. It typically has no publicly elected officials [of its own] or power to tax.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Paragraph 76, as amended, further clarifies the possibilities for entities to be considered public entity risk pools. It provides:</div><div class="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1">If an entity provides insurance or risk management coverage <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">separate from its own risk management activities</b> to individuals or organizations outside the governmental reporting entity and there is material transfer or pooling of risk among the participants, that activity should be accounted for as a public entity risk pool.... If an entity provides risk transfer or pooling coverage <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">combined with its own risk management activities</b> to individuals or organizations outside its reporting entity, those activities should continue to be reported in a governmental fund or an internal service fund only as long as the entity is the predominant participant in the fund. If the entity is not the predominant participant in the fund, then the combined activities should be reported as a public entity risk pool, using an enterprise fund and the accounting and reporting requirements in paragraphs 19–50 [as amended].... [Footnote reference omitted.]</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Applying the definitions in paragraphs 10–12 and paragraph 76, as amended, the key characteristics of a public entity risk pool can be derived as follows:</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">a.<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">The pool should comprise primarily governmental entities.</b> It was intended that the provisions of Statement 10, as amended, specifically in paragraph 76, as amended, apply to risk financing groups of primarily state and local governments, while recognizing that there may be some cases where the group has a minority of participants—in terms of both representation and risk coverage—that are nongovernmental.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">b.<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">The pool should be a cooperative effort.</b> It was intended that participants would work together to finance risk. Evidence of a cooperative effort may be voluntary participation in the activity—even if participation is a participant&#39;s last recourse. If a cooperative effort does not exist, then a governmental program may actually exist, and contributions from participants may actually be fees, assessments, or taxes—not premiums (required contributions). A governmental program could be accounted for in the general fund, a special revenue fund, or an enterprise fund depending on its nature. Statement No. 54, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Fund Balance Reporting and Governmental Fund Type Definitions</b>, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs54_par.29">paragraphs 29–32</span>, offers guidance on when the general fund or special revenue fund can be used. Statement 34, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._66">paragraphs 66 and 67</span>, as amended, offers guidance on when an enterprise fund can be used.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Furthermore, the types of risks or benefits covered by a potential pool are required to be within the scope of Statement 10, as amended.
