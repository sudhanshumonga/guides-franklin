In a crossover refunding, both the refunded debt and the refunding issued debt are reported on the statement of net position until the crossover date. In calculating net position, are both the refunded and refunding debt included in &quot;net investment in capital assets&quot; or should the refunding bonds be netted against the restricted assets that are set aside for refunding the old bonds on the crossover date? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The refunding debt is not capital related until it refunds (defeases) the old debt, which normally occurs at the crossover date. Prior to that time, the refunding debt likely would not significantly affect net position because the refunding bond liability would generally equal the remaining cash and investments associated with the refunding bond proceeds. At the defeasance of the old debt, the refunding debt takes on the characteristics of the old debt and would be included in the calculation of &quot;net investment in capital assets.&quot;</div></body></html>
