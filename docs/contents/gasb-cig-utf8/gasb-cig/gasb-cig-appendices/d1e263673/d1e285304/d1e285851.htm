Two members of the district's five-member governing board are appointed by the county board of commissioners; the three other members are elected in a general election. The basic operations of the district are financed primarily by county appropriations and through donated county services that include personnel, office space, and utility costs. In addition, the district receives some funding from federal and state sources and from fund-raising activities. The district adopts its own budget, is legally responsible for its own debts, designates its own management, and controls its day-to-day operations. The county is not entitled to any surpluses, or responsible for deficits, of the district. The district also has the authority to issue tax-exempt bonds.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The district meets the definition of a primary government and would not be included in the reporting entity of the county. The district is legally separate, a majority of the governing body of the district is separately elected, and the district is fiscally independent. The district's reliance on the county's continued financial support would not create a <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fiscal dependency</b> relationship between the district and the county.</div></body></html>
