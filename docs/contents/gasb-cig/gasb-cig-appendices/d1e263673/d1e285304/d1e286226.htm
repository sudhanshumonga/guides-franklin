Historically, the booster club has provided funds to the high school to charter buses to transport the school football team to its away games each year and to cover the school&#39;s cost of replacing the marching band&#39;s uniforms every five years. The club solicits contributions from area merchants and conducts annual fundraisers, such as bake sales, carnivals, and car raffles. Although the booster club provides financial support for the charter buses and band uniforms, these funds are insignificant to the school district.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>The booster club is not <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">required</b> to be reported as a component unit of Public School District #115 because one of the three criteria is not met. BBR High School Booster Club&#39;s economic resources are entirely for the direct benefit of the high school and the &quot;entitlement/ability to access&quot; criterion is met because the booster club historically has supported the high school&#39;s activities. However, the third criterion is not met because the economic resources received or held by the booster club that are required to be used for the benefit of the high school are insignificant to the school district.</div></body></html>
