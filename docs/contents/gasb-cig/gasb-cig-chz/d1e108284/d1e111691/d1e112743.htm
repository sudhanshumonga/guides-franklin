Although the individual rights included in the bundle of rights of property are separable and intangible in nature, they collectively represent the ownership of a tangible asset—the associated property. Therefore, the value of the individual rights in the bundle of rights of property ownership should remain aggregated and reported as a tangible capital asset (land or property). Additionally, because these land use rights are considered part of the tangible capital asset (the associated property) and the property is reported at historical cost, the reported value of the property already includes consideration for all rights associated with the government’s ownership of that asset. In contrast, land use rights that were acquired in a transaction that did not involve acquiring the underlying property should be reported as an intangible asset (at historical cost), if they meet the description of an intangible asset.</div></body></html>
