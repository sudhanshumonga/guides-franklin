To enhance readability, the number of items in the reconciliation should be kept to a minimum, but they should not be so aggregated as to be misleading. Similarly, the explanations of the items in the reconciliation should be brief. In many cases, brief explanations will be sufficient to allow users to assess the relationship between the statements. Preparers will need to balance the competing goals of providing enough information to be useful, but not so much as to be distracting.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The level of detail presented will generally be a function of the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">location</b> of the reconciliation. If it is presented on a separate page, as a continuation of the financial statement, much more detail can be presented than would be possible on the face of the fund financial statements and, consequently, less additional explanation would be needed in the notes.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Paragraph 77 of Statement 34 establishes the overall requirement for reconciling fund-based information to the statements of net position and activities. It also specifies when additional information should be disclosed in the notes.</div><div class="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1">77. Governments should present a summary reconciliation to the government-wide financial statements at the bottom of the fund financial statements or in an accompanying schedule. In many cases, brief explanations presented on the face of the statements will be sufficient to allow users to assess the relationship between the statements. However, if aggregated information in the summary reconciliation obscures the nature of the individual elements of a particular reconciling item, governments should provide a more detailed explanation in the notes to financial statements.</div><div class="ps_centered_heading_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_centered_heading_1">* * *</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Differences between the fund financial statements and the government-wide statements generally exist for three reasons:</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">1.Differences in the measurement focus</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">2.Differences in the basis of accounting</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">3.Reclassifications.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The first two differences apply only to governmental funds and activities. Enterprise funds and business-type activities use the same measurement focus and basis of accounting. For many governments, the amounts reported for total enterprise funds will be the same as the amounts reported for business-type activities in the government-wide statements—thus, no reconciliation will be required for those funds and activities.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Having different measurement focuses means that <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">what</b> is being measured is different. In governmental funds, current financial resources are measured, but in the government-wide statements, economic resources are measured. To illustrate the difference, bond proceeds are a source of financing in the funds, whereas in the government-wide statements they represent a liability. Using different bases of accounting means that <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">when</b> transactions and events are measured is different. For example, under the modified accrual basis of accounting in the governmental funds, property tax revenue is recognized if it is &quot;available.&quot; Under the accrual basis in the government-wide statements, property tax revenue is recognized in the period for which levied-regardless of when it is collected. Differences between the fund statements and the government-wide statements may also arise when activities accounted for in proprietary funds (internal service funds, for example) are reported as governmental activities (or vice versa) in the government-wide statements.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The reconciliations included in the illustrative statements in nonauthoritative <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_illustration_a__illustrative_financial_statements_for_a_municipal_government__rec1">Appendix B7-1 (Illustrations A, B, and C)</span> and in nonauthoritative <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_appendix_B7-2">Appendix B7-2</span> present reconciling items caused by all three types of differences and represent typical adjustments that most governments will likely have to make.
