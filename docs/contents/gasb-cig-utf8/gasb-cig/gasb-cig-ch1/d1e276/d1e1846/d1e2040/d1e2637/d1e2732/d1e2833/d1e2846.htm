Both terms indicate that the investment securities are issued in or endorsed to the name of a securities depository, broker-dealer, or other financial services company, on behalf of the true beneficial owners of the investment securities.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The term <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">nominee name</b> denotes arrangements used principally by institutional investors and financial agents (such as bank and trust companies) for the registration of securities held by them for their own account or the accounts of customers. In most instances, the nominee is a partnership formed solely for the purpose of acting as record holder of the investment securities. Perhaps the largest use of nominee name arrangements is by securities depositories on behalf of their participants.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The term <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">street name</b> is used by the securities industry to denote securities registered in the name of a brokerage firm or its nominee. Such securities frequently belong to customers of the firm.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Investment securities are held in street or nominee name to allow the transfer of the beneficial ownership of securities from one party to another without re-registration and with a minimum of physical movement of the paper. The use of street or nominee names for the registration of paper securities does not change the fact that a custodian is "holding in the name of the government." This is because of the presumption underlying the use of street or nominee name registration that another party may be the true beneficial owner.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Investment securities in the nominee name of a securities depository are referred to as "book entry" securities. Questions 1.23.1–1.23.4 discuss how to evaluate <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">book entry systems</b> for purposes of applying the "held in the name of the government" criterion. For investment securities owned by a government and registered in or endorsed to the street or nominee name of the custodial broker-dealer or other financial agent, the "held in the name of the government" criterion is met if the custodian's internal records identify the government as the owner of the investment securities. If the securities are pledged to the government as collateral for deposits or for repurchase agreements, the only difference in meeting the criterion is that the custodian's internal records should identify the government as the pledgee of the securities.</div></body></html>
