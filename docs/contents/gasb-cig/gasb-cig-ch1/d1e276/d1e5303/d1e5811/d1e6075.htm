As depicted in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._16">paragraph 16b</span> of Statement 40, a variable-rate investment with a coupon set at 4 percent minus the three-month LIBOR with a floor of 1 percent is shown to be an example of a highly sensitive investment. Usually with most variable-rate debt investments, as interest rates change, the fair value of the debt investment reprices to par at each interest rate reset date. However, with inverse floater instruments, not only does the fair value of the debt investment change as interest rates change, but the fair value changes according to both the change in the market rate of interest and the rate of interest paid by the coupon. For example, if the three-month LIBOR from paragraph 16b were to increase from 1.5 percent to 3.0 percent, the fair value of the debt investment would be calculated using a coupon rate of 1 percent instead of 2.5 percent, causing an investment that had a positive fair value to become an investment with a negative fair value.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">A simulation model depicts the monetary impact that changes in interest rates have on a variable-rate investment with a coupon that varies inversely with a benchmark index.
