Required annual contributions to the fund are actuarially determined. Participants pay a pro rata share of the required annual contributions based on total payroll costs for the prior year. The county participates in this fund for its own workers' compensation costs. It has 30 percent of the covered payroll; the local governments have 65 percent of the covered payroll, and not-for-profit organizations have 5 percent of the covered payroll.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> This meets the definition of a risk-sharing public entity risk pool: The participants are primarily local governmental units, the sponsor (the county) is not the predominant participant, there is a cooperative effort, and there is transfer of risk.</div></body></html>
