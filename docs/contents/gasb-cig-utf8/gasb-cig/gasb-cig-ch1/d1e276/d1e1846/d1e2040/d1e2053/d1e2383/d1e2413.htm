A trust department is a separate fiduciary function authorized by and regulated under various state and federal laws. The term <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">trust </b>department as used in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._8" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._8">paragraphs 8 and 9</span> of Statement 40 refers only to the trust departments of financial institutions such as commercial banks and savings banks. Assets held by those trust departments as custodial agents for outside parties are considered legally separate from the assets of the financial institution and are held strictly on a fiduciary basis. Safekeeping departments are not considered trust departments for the purpose of custodial credit risk. Custody by a safekeeping department should be evaluated as custody by a financial institution rather than as custody by a trust department.</div></body></html>
