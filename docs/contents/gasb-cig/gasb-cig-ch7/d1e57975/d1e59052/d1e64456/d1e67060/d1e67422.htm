Rather, as an economy and efficiency measure, the government uses the general fund to buy office supplies and spreads the cost to programs based on use or requisitions. On the other hand, the treatment and distribution of water and the generation and sale of electricity are programs of the utility funds. The government’s programs are purchasers of the utility fund’s services (like its other customers); therefore, the internal activity is characterized as interfund services provided and used rather than reimbursements.</div></body></html>
