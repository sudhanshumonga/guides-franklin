If the general fund is used, governments should adapt this to a modified accrual basis of accounting. Interpretation No. 6, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Recognition and Measurement of Certain Liabilities and Expenditures in Governmental Fund Financial Statements,</b> provides that a governmental fund liability and expenditure should be recognized to the extent liabilities mature (come due for payment) each period (paragraph 14). If the $3 million in unpaid claims meets the definition of a governmental fund liability, the general fund should report the entire $11 million expenditure and $1 million liability in the fund. If the general fund reported the claims servicing, there would be a reconciliation to the government-wide statement of net position to the extent that there are differences between the liability recognized in the general fund and the liability recognized for governmental activities in the statement of net position.</div></body></html>
