In order to apply the regulatory accounting provisions of Statement 62, the utility is required to determine the amount that otherwise should be reported as revenue or expense. That determination occurs only after consideration of whether a derivative instrument is a hedging derivative instrument, that is only after the derivative instrument is determined to be effective in significantly reducing an identified financial risk (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_hedging_derivative_instruments_par.26">paragraphs 26–62</span> of Statement 53). For example, a regulated gas utility purchases futures contracts to hedge price risk associated with a future natural gas purchase. Whether the futures contracts are effective hedges of future natural gas purchases should first be evaluated, for example, by employing the synthetic instrument method. If the futures contracts are effective, any fair value increases and decreases on the futures contracts should be reported as deferred inflows of resources or deferred outflows of resources, having no impact on the resource flows statement. <span class="fn-callout  fn display-inline" id="CompQA_Ch10_fn2" data-attr-callout="11" data-attr-outputclass=""><span class="prefix-content">11</span><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">CQA, Chapter 10, Footnote 11—For purposes of questions in this chapter, the term <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">resource flows statement</b> includes the statement of activities; the statement of revenues, expenses and changes in fund net position; and the statement of changes in fiduciary net position required to be reported as components of the basic financial statements.</div></span> </div></body></html>
