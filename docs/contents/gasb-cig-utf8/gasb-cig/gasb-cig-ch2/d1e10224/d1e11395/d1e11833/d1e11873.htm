It is intended to complement the accrual-basis financial statements. The classification of cash flows provides functional information about financing and investing activities. This approach concentrates on the underlying nature of a transaction. Therefore, earnings on investments should be classified as investing activities, regardless of why the investments are made, what the earnings are used for, and where the income is reported on the operating statement. (Except that interest received on qualifying program loans should be classified as operating inflows.
