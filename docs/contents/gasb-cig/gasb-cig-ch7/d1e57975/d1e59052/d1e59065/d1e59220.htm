For example, can a city combine its parks department (accounted for in the general fund) and its driving range enterprise fund as a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">parks and recreation</b> governmental program in the statement of activities?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">if</b> the minimum requirements in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_statement_of_the_governmental_accounting_standards_board">paragraph 10</span> of Statement No. 37, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Basic Financial Statements—and Management&#39;s Discussion and Analysis—for State and Local Governments: Omnibus</b>, are satisfied. That paragraph provides that activities accounted for in governmental funds should be presented at least at the level of detail required in the governmental fund statement of revenues, expenditures, and changes in fund balances, and that activities accounted for in enterprise funds should be presented by different identifiable activities. Therefore, the city could combine its parks department and its driving range operation as a single governmental program unless the driving range is a different identifiable activity or the &quot;parks department&quot; is a required functional category in the fund financial statements. Nevertheless, if the paragraph 10 requirements prohibit combination, both items could be <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">separately reported</b> as governmental activities under a &quot;parks and recreation&quot; heading. The reconciliations from the governmental and enterprise fund financial statements to the government-wide statements would explain the reclassification of the driving range enterprise fund.</div></body></html>
