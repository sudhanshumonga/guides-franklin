Therefore, determining the appropriate accounting treatment for outlays associated with business process reengineering activities should be done separately from determining the recognition of outlays associated with developing computer software. Generally, outlays associated with business process reengineering activities should be expensed as incurred. A business process reengineering project may enhance a government’s ability to provide service capacity; however, it constitutes a reorganization or redeployment of current resources, as opposed to the creation of a new resource in which service capacity is embodied. If a new resource was acquired as part of the business process reengineering activities, for example, a piece of equipment to carry out a new procedure, the outlays associated with the acquisition of that resource should be capitalized as an asset. </div></body></html>
