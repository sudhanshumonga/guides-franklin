How should such outlays be accounted for when the activities are associated with the acquisition of computer software that is not considered internally generated? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>The concept underlying the guidance for outlays associated with data conversion and user training involved in the development of internally generated computer software is that the cost of a capital asset should include ancillary charges necessary to place the asset into its intended location and condition for use as described in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._18">paragraph 18</span> of Statement 34, as amended. This concept applies similarly for computer software that is not considered internally generated. Outlays associated with data conversion activities should be capitalized as an ancillary cost of the acquired computer software only if those activities are determined to be necessary to make the software operational. Otherwise, such outlays should be expensed as incurred. Outlays associated with user training should not be considered an ancillary cost of acquired computer software, and, therefore, those outlays should be expensed as incurred. </div></body></html>
