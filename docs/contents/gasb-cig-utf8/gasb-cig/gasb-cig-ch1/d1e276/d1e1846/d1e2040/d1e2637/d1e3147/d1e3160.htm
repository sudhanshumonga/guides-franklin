A custodian that is the government's agent also will be able to provide information about the form of the investment securities (bearer, registered, or book entry) and whether correspondent custodians, street or nominee names, and custodial or fiduciary book entry accounts are being used. Safekeeping or trust receipts or some other notification from the custodian (such as periodic statements) and written confirmations with the custodian can provide information about whether its internal records identify the government as the owner or pledgee of securities.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If a custodian that is the counterparty's trust department or agent provides the government with notification about securities owned by or pledged to the government, that custodian is able to provide the government with the necessary information about custodial operations.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If a custodian that is the counterparty's trust department or agent <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">does not</b> provide the government with safekeeping or trust notices, it also may not be a useful source of information about custodial operations. This is because the custodian may not be "holding in the government's name" and may not be aware that the government has a valid interest in the securities. In this situation, as well as situations in which the counterparty is the custodian, information can be obtained from or through the counterparty. Although the deposits and investments would be subject to custodial credit risk disclosures in these situations, understanding the custodial operations will allow the government to be better informed about the nature of the custodial credit risk in the arrangement.</div></body></html>
