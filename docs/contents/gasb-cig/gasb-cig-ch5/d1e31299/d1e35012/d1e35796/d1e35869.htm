Should the nonemployer entity’s involvement be accounted for as a special funding situation? If not, which accounting and financial reporting standards apply?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The first characteristic of a special funding situation as described in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_special_funding_situations">paragraph 15</span> of Statement 68 is that the nonemployer entity is legally responsible for making contributions directly to the pension plan. A historical pattern of appropriating resources to make contributions directly to the pension plan is not equivalent to a legal obligation for the nonemployer entity to make contributions to the pension plan. Therefore, in this circumstance, the nonemployer entity’s involvement should not be accounted for as a special funding situation. The employers that provide benefits through the plan should apply the requirements of Statement 68, as amended, for employers that are not in special funding situations. In periods in which it makes contributions, the nonemployer entity should apply the requirements of <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#paying_government_reporting_rec1">paragraph 13</span> of Statement No. 24, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Accounting and Financial Reporting for Certain Grants and Other Financial Assistance, </b>as amended, for on-behalf payments of fringe benefits.</div></body></html>
