Subsequently, the government uses some of the revenues for another purpose. The government reevaluates the legal enforceability of the restriction, as required by <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs46_par._5">paragraph 5</span> of Statement 46. Based on its professional judgment, the government determines that the restriction is not legally enforceable and reports the accumulated resources and all future resources generated by the tax as unrestricted from that period forward. Several years later, however, the government is sued, and the court orders the government to use the resources only for the purpose specified by the legislation. How should the net position be reported?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Unless the court order specifies which resources are restricted, the components of net position generated by the sales tax should be reported as restricted—and disclosed in the notes to the financial statements as restricted by enabling legislation—beginning in the period during which the court judgment was rendered.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs46_par._3">Paragraph 3</span> of Statement 46 cautions that legal enforceability cannot ultimately be proven unless tested through the judicial process. Until such time, professional judgment relies on available evidence. At the time the government used the tax revenues for nonspecified purposes, there may have been no reason to believe that an outside party could compel the government to honor the restriction imposed by the enabling legislation; in fact, there may have been no prior instances in which a court compelled the government or similar governments.</div></body></html>
