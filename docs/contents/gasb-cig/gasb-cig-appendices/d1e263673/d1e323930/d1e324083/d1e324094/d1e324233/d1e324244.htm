The variability of the cash flows of the bond coupons is affected by more than changes in the benchmark interest rate. For example, changes in the credit quality of the city’s bonds could affect its remarket rates. The city’s specific objective, however, is to offset changes in the cash flows of the bond coupons (a cash flow hedge) attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The relevant benchmark interest rate is the SIFMA swap index.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Because the terms of the bonds and the interest rate swap are consistent, the city uses the consistent critical terms method to evaluate effectiveness as of the end of the reporting period. The following table shows how the critical terms of the pay-fixed, receive-variable swap are consistent with the critical terms of the variable-rate demand bonds:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Upon association with the variable-rate demand bonds, the pay-fixed, receive-variable swap has a zero fair value. The fixed rate (3.80716 percent) and the formula to determine the variable rate of the swap (SIFMA swap index) remains the same throughout the life of the swap.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Because the critical terms are consistent, the changes in cash flows of the swap will substantially offset the changes in cash flows of the variable-rate demand bonds attributable to changes in the SIFMA swap index. Therefore, the swap is a hedging derivative instrument, and hedge accounting is applied. At the end of each subsequent reporting period, the city verifies that the critical terms have not changed.</div></body></html>
