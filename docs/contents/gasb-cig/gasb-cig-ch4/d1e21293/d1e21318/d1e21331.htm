Paragraph 9 of Statement 14, as amended, states:</div><div class="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1">The requirements of this Statement apply at all levels to all state and local governments. The Statement applies to financial reporting by primary governments, governmental joint ventures, jointly governed organizations, and other stand-alone governments; and it applies to the separately issued financial reports of governmental component units. This includes governmental enterprises, public benefit corporations and authorities, public employee retirement systems, governmental utilities, governmental hospitals and other healthcare providers, and governmental colleges and universities. [Footnote reference omitted.]</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Paragraph 12, as amended, reiterates this position, stating:</div><div class="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1">. . . The nucleus of a financial reporting entity usually is a primary government. However, a governmental organization other than a primary government (such as a component unit, a joint venture, a jointly governed organization, or another stand-alone government) serves as the nucleus for its own reporting entity when it issues separate financial reports. Although this Statement is written from the perspective of the primary government, its requirements apply to the separately issued basic financial statements of governmental component units, joint ventures, jointly governed organizations, and other stand-alone governments. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">An organization that is a component unit of a financial reporting entity may have component units of its own. For example, a school district may be a component unit of a county because the county appoints the governing board of the district, and the district imposes a financial burden on the county. The school district also could be financially accountable for an educational foundation and thus apply the provisions of Statement 14, as amended, to the foundation when the foundation is included in the school district’s separately issued basic financial statements.</div></body></html>
