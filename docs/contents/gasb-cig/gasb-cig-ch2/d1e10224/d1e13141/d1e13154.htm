Changes in the balance of an asset or a liability that are not attributable to cash transactions should be considered noncash transactions. For example, when an enterprise fund enters into a capital lease for a building, a noncash transaction occurs because a capital lease obligation and the building are recorded in the statement of net position. The inception of an <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">operating</b> lease, on the other hand, requires no disclosure because there is no effect on the statement of net position. </div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">c.<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Is the transaction an investing, capital, or financing activity?</b> A noncash transaction should be disclosed only when it (had it been a cash transaction) meets the definition of the investing, capital and related financing, or noncapital financing activities category. For example, a capital lease transaction meets the definition of a capital and related financing activity. However, a customer account receivable balance that was used to offset an account payable to that customer is an operating activity and is not required to be disclosed.
