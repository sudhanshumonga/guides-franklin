The purpose can be broad or narrow and still be considered restricted, as long as the constraints meet the definition in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#restricted_net_assets_rec1">paragraph 34</span> of Statement 34, as amended. However, the purpose should not be so broad that, in substance, it establishes no purpose restrictions narrower than the general restriction of the activity. For instance, resources that are required to be used for &quot;governmental activities&quot; are not considered restricted in the general fund. Similarly, resources that are required by a rate payer agreement to be used only for “water and sewer fund purposes” should not be classified as restricted in the water and sewer fund.
