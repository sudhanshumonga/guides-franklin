Generally, cash equivalents are measured at other than fair value (including amortized cost) and, consequently, are not subject to the fair value disclosure requirements of Statement 72. Specific exceptions to fair value measurement for some investments are described in paragraph 69 of Statement 72, as amended. Examples of such investments include certain money market investments and nonparticipating interest-earning investment contracts, such as certain nonnegotiable certificates of deposit. If a cash equivalent is measured at fair value, the fair value disclosure requirements of Statement 72 apply.</div></body></html>
