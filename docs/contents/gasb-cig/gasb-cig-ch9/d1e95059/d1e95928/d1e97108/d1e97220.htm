Paragraph 21a refers to the period for which the taxes are levied, which generally is the fiscal year when the revenues are to be used. According to <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs44_footnote_7">footnote 7</span> of Statement 44, however, paragraph 21b refers to &quot;the period for collecting and distributing taxes that ends when the collector makes final scheduled distribution of the current year&#39;s taxes and begins the levy and collection process for the next year&#39;s taxes.&quot; The period for collecting and distributing taxes may differ from the period for which the taxes are levied. The amount governments should present for collections on the levy should be the amount collected prior to the final scheduled distribution of the current year&#39;s taxes. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">For example, if a government has a January 1–December 31 fiscal year, the property taxes for each fiscal year actually are levied during the prior calendar year. Thus, the property tax revenues for its fiscal year ending December 31, 20Y5, were levied during 20Y4 and were payable by February 20Y5. In this scenario, the most recent period for which property taxes were levied is fiscal year 20Y5. Therefore, the revenue capacity schedules would cover fiscal years 19X6–20Y5. The rates imposed to produce the property tax revenues in fiscal year 20Y5 would be labeled “fiscal year 20Y5” even though they were levied in calendar year 20Y4. The property values would be presented as calendar years or tax years 19X5–20Y4; however, the presentation of the total direct rates in the same schedule will enable the user to crosswalk the schedules and thereby connect the calendar-year (tax-year) property values with the fiscal year 20Y5 information in the other revenue capacity schedules.</div></body></html>
