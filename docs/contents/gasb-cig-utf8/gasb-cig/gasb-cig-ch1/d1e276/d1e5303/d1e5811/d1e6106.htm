For governments holding significant concentrations of highly sensitive investments with varying terms, how may the government choose to display the aggregated disclosure requirements?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Provided that the portfolio percentage disclosures do not confuse the content of the disclosures, a government may choose to aggregate its highly sensitive investment terms as percentages of the total portfolio. Governments may have long-term strategic asset allocation policies that provide diversification over many asset classes in order to reduce interest rate risk. For example, a pension plan holds a portfolio of 125 individual highly sensitive investments. Thirty of the investments represent 20 percent of the fair value of the portfolio and contain coupon multipliers ranging from 1.25 to 2.5 times the 3-month LIBOR rate. The public employee retirement system (PERS) in this case may disclose that 20 percent of the fair value of its portfolio is invested in securities with coupon multipliers ranging from 1.25 to 2.5 times the 3-month LIBOR. Alternatively, a government may choose to aggregate its highly sensitive investment terms by dollar value. For example, the PERS may indicate that $25 million of the portfolio's investments are contained within securities with coupon multipliers ranging from 1.25 to 2.5 times the 3-month LIBOR.</div></body></html>
