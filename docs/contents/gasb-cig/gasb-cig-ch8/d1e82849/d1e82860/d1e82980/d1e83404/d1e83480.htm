The life insurance benefits are administered by the PERS that also administers the defined benefit pension plan. If the assets for the life insurance benefits are commingled for investment purposes with the assets of the pension plan but are accounted for by the PERS as separate defined benefit plans, and if the financing for the life insurance benefits (usually a one-year term insurance basis) is separate from the financing for the monthly pension benefit, should the life insurance benefit be considered a pension benefit or an OPEB for accounting and financial reporting purposes? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—In the circumstances described, the life insurance benefit is administered by the PERS but provided separately from the defined benefit pension plan. Although assets related to both benefits are combined for investment purposes, separate accounting for each defined benefit plan is maintained. Therefore, the life insurance benefit is considered OPEB for accounting purposes, and Statement 45 applies.</div></body></html>
