As the security should have been recognized in full as an investment when purchased, the security does not meet the definition of a derivative instrument because there is no leverage. For example, U.S. government treasury securities and agencies may be purchased on a when-issued basis. The obligation to purchase the securities includes specific identification of the security in the form of a Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures number, price, date of issue, and other significant terms. That security should be recognized as an investment at its full amount with a corresponding payable. There would be no derivative instrument.</div></body></html>
