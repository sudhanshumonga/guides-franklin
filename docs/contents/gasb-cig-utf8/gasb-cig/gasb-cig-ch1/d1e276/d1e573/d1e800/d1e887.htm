Short-term investing activities are conducted in an internal investment pool. Longer term investments for specific funds—such as debt service reserve and capital projects funds—are purchased on an individual basis. Should short-term and long-term investing activity be delineated in the investment disclosures?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Statements 3 and 40, as amended, focus on the deposit and investment risks of the primary government and permit aggregation of such disclosures. However, a government may choose to segregate certain of its investing activities to disclose the risks associated with each maturity. The existence of large differences in investing practices, such as internal pooling or purchasing discrete investments, may be indicative of a need for separate disclosure at the fund level for the weighted average maturity when the risk exposure is significantly greater than that of the primary government.
