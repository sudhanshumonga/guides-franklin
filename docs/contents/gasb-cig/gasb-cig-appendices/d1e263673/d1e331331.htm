The government’s policy is to use restricted resources before unrestricted and it adopts the default policy for the use of its unrestricted resources. The fund includes amounts that have been restricted, committed, or assigned to three specific purposes: signage and lighting, road maintenance, and bridge repair. In the current year, the government committed $120,000 to bridge repair. Also, an additional $1,500 was assigned to road maintenance. The government incurred $4,654 of expenditures related to signage and lighting, $10,000 of expenditures related to road maintenance, and $11,223 of expenditures related to bridge repair.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_1">To determine the ending balances in each classification, the government should start with the balances that were committed and assigned at the beginning of the year, add amounts in the fund that have been committed or assigned during the year, then subtract expenditures made for the specific committed or assigned purposes. The following illustrates the calculation of the ending fund balance classifications.</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Example 2</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_1">Using the same facts as in Example 1, assume that the government has adopted a policy that it uses assigned resources first, followed by committed amounts. If the government’s policy is to use restricted resources first and then assigned resources followed by committed amounts, the ending balances for the special revenue fund would be determined as follows:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Example 3</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_1">Modifying Example 2, assume that $7,654 was spent for signage and lighting purposes, rather than $4,654, resulting in a deficit for that purpose of ($1,958). In that instance, the government would first reduce balances assigned to other purposes in the fund (the specific purposes that would be reduced is at the government’s discretion) until the deficit is eliminated. However, if the deficit exceeds the remaining assigned balances in the fund, the residual amount should be reported as negative unassigned fund balance. </div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_cqa_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_1">The effect of overspending for the specific purpose would change if it was in the general fund rather than a special revenue fund.</div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Example 4</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_1">Using the same policy as in Example 3, if overspending for a specific purpose occurs in the general fund, the deficit should be eliminated by first reducing unassigned fund balance until depleted and then reducing amounts assigned to other purposes as follows:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div></body></html>
