The objective of the interest rate lock is to hedge interest rate risk. That is, the risk that changes in the benchmark interest rate, in this case the AAA general obligations index, will adversely affect the cash flows of the bonds the school district plans to issue in the future. The potential hedging derivative instrument is the interest rate lock. The hedgeable items are the expected bonds. Based on the consistency of the terms of the interest rate lock and the expected bonds, the school district determines that the interest rate lock is a hedging derivative instrument using the consistent critical terms method. Accordingly, changes in fair values of the interest rate lock are reported as deferred outflows of resources or deferred inflows of resources in the statement of net position over the life of the interest rate lock.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Upon issuance of the bonds, the interest rate lock is terminated. Because the interest rate lock has a positive fair value to the school district, the school district receives a payment from the counterparty. In the government-wide financial statements, the payment is reported as an asset. The deferred inflow of resources is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense in a systematic and rational manner over the life of the fixed-rate bonds.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">This illustration provides the journal entries and the financial statement presentation related to the interest rate lock and the hedged expected issuance of bonds. </div></body></html>
