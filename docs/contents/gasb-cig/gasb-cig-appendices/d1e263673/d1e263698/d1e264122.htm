In this illustration, WAMs are computed for each fund type. The portfolio’s WAM is derived by dollar-weighting the WAM for each fund type. The focus of this disclosure is on the aggregate weighted average maturity of the entire investment portfolio; however, disclosure is made at the fund level for the weighted average maturity of the capital projects fund when the risk exposure is significantly greater than that of the primary government.</div></body></html>
