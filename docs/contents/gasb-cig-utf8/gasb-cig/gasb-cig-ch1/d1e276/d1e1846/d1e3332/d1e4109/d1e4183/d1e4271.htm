How should governments evaluate deposits that are collateralized by such a pool?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Multiple financial institution collateral pools are discussed in (nonauthoritative) <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasbs3_par._11" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs3_par._11">paragraph 11</span> of Statement 3. In a multiple financial institution collateral pool, a group of financial institutions holding public funds pledge collateral to a common pool. Statutes authorizing these pools specify the amount of collateral that is required to be pledged by each financial institution—usually a certain percentage of the uninsured public deposits it holds. If any member financial institution fails, the entire collateral pool becomes available to satisfy the claims of governmental entities.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">In many jurisdictions that have multiple financial institution collateral pools, if the value of the pool's collateral is inadequate to cover a loss, additional amounts would be assessed on a pro rata basis to the members of the pool to ensure that there will be no loss of public funds. As a result, a multiple financial institution collateral pool <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">that provides for additional assessments</b> is similar to deposit insurance and does not require disclosure of custodial credit risk.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">However, if a multiple financial institution collateral pool <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">cannot make additional assessments,</b> the deposits should be considered collateralized rather than insured. The extent to which the pool collateralizes those deposits is determined by comparing each individual member financial institution's total uninsured public deposits with the fair value of the pool's assets. For example, if the pool's asset value exceeds the total uninsured public deposits of an individual member financial institution, all uninsured public deposits with that financial institution should be considered fully collateralized. If, however, the pool's value is only 50 percent of the total uninsured public deposits of a member financial institution, each of that financial institution's uninsured public deposits would be only 50 percent collateralized. Evaluating a multiple financial institution collateral pool that cannot make additional assessments for purposes of determining custodial credit risk involves many of the same issues and considerations as with a single financial institution collateral pool, discussed in Questions 1.37.1 and 1.37.2.</div></body></html>
