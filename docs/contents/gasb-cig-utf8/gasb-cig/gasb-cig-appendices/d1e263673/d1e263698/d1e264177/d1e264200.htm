The city's investment policy limits investments in corporate bonds to the top two ratings issued by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs). Through its investment policy, the city manages its exposure to fair value losses arising from increasing interest rates by limiting the modified duration of its investment portfolio to less than nine months (0.75 years).</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Securities underlying repurchase agreements take the form of U.S. Treasuries.</div></body></html>
