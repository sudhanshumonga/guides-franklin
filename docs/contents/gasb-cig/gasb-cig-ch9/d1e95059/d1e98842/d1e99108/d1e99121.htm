Comparisons with peer entities can add contextual meaning that cannot be obtained when looking at the information of a single government. Comparative information can help a user to make judgments about the strength of a particular government&#39;s economic condition in relation to the economic condition of similar entities. (See, for example, the comparative revenue rate information illustrated in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_E-6">Exhibit E-6</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B9-2.)</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Governments should be cautious, however, that any comparative information they present is indeed <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">comparable.</b> For example, definitions of assessed value vary from state to state, and even from locality to locality within some states. Furthermore, it should be noted that statistical section information is not principally intended to foster intergovernmental comparisons, although it ultimately may be used in that manner. Rather, the general focus of the statistical section is to assist the user of the financial report in using the basic financial statements, notes, and required supplementary information to understand and assess that particular government&#39;s economic condition.</div></body></html>
