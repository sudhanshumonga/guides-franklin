According to the terms of the bequest, the principal of the gift is required to remain intact and the earnings are required to be used for improvements to the college’s fine arts center. At the end of the current fiscal year, the fair value of the endowment has dropped to $4.85 million. Because the original amount is nonexpendable, should the college report restricted nonexpendable net position of $5 million or $4.85 million? If the market recovers in the following year and the endowment value increases to $5.15 million, what amounts are reported in the restricted nonexpendable component of net position and restricted expendable component of net position?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—In the current year, restricted nonexpendable net position should be reported at $4.85 million.
