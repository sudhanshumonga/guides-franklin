Some organizations may operate activities, such as off-track betting or lotteries, for the principal purpose of generating net revenues that are accessible to the primary government. These organizations provide financial benefits to the primary government. Other organizations may operate activities (for example, public utilities) for the purpose of providing basic public services and charge rates sufficiently high to also provide a financial benefit to the primary government. These benefits may be characterized as &quot;payments in lieu of taxes&quot; or &quot;contributions,&quot; or they may simply be amounts remitted on request of the primary government. These organizations also provide financial benefits to the primary government.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">These inflows are not &quot;taxes.&quot; They are generally subsidies and, in those cases, should be classified as a financial benefit. However, payments that are directly related to the cost of specific governmental services provided by the city may be viewed as exchange transactions. For example, if the city provides water to the potential component unit and requires that the potential component unit make payments &quot;in lieu of taxes&quot; approximately equal to the costs of providing water service, it would be an exchange transaction. Payments that cannot be directly attributed to service provided, however, would be deemed a financial benefit to the city.</div></body></html>
