Statutes require that the fund be reported as a trust fund. What type of fund should be used for financial statement purposes?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Although a trust fund may seem appropriate because of the trust agreement and legal requirement, Statement 10, as amended, requires that if a government uses a single fund to account for its risk financing activities, that fund could be the general fund, a special revenue fund, or an internal service fund for GAAP-basis financial statement purposes; the use of a trust fund is precluded. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_fund_classification_rec1">Question 3.49.1</span>.) Therefore, the legal basis will be different from the GAAP basis. NCGA Statement 1, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Governmental Accounting and Financial Reporting Principles</b>, under the heading &quot;Conflicts between Legal Provisions and GAAP&quot; indicates that &quot;conflicts between legal provisions and GAAP do not require maintaining two accounting systems. Rather, the accounting system may be maintained on a legal-compliance basis, but should include sufficient additional records to permit GAAP-based reporting&quot; (paragraph 13 of NCGA Statement 1); and &quot;the basic financial statements of governmental units should be prepared in conformity with GAAP&quot; (paragraph 11 of that Statement).</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">An internal service fund can be used to segregate the health benefits fund from other general governmental activities, and it can be used effectively to charge premiums to other units of the government, if necessary, as discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs10_par._66">paragraph 66</span> of Statement 10, as amended. Alternatively, the general fund or a qualifying special revenue fund can be used to account for this program.</div></body></html>
