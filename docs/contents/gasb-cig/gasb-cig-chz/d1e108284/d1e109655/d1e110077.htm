First, the accumulated depreciation account may be increased by the amount of the loss. Second, both the capital asset historical cost account and related accumulated depreciation account could be decreased proportionately such that the net decrease equals the impairment loss. In the former circumstance, the impairment is treated as if additional years of useful life of the capital asset had been used up through the impairment. In the latter circumstance, the impairment is treated like a disposal of a portion of the capital asset.</div></body></html>
