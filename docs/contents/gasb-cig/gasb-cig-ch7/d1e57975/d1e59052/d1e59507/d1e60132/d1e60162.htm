Ownership of land and buildings, for example, can usually be clearly determined through review of appropriate documents, such as deeds, easements, and contracts. Ownership of infrastructure associated with land, such as roads, sidewalks, and sewers, may not be as clearly documented. In such cases, the government with primary responsibility for managing the asset should report the asset.</div></body></html>
