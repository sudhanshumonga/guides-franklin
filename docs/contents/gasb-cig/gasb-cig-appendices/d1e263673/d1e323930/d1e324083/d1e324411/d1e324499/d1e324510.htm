Fixed coupons on bonds that are expected to be issued are in substance floating rates until the date when the bonds are issued, at which time the coupon rate is determined and the coupons have a fixed, stated rate. The relevant benchmark interest rate is the AAA general obligations index. The principal amount and maturity date of the bonds are detailed in the bond ordinance approved by the school board. The school district uses the consistent critical terms method to evaluate effectiveness. The following table shows how the critical terms of the interest rate lock are consistent with the critical terms of the expected bonds:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="print_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="print;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Upon association with the expected bonds, the interest rate lock has a zero fair value.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Because the critical terms are consistent, the cash flows to be received or paid at the termination of the interest rate lock will substantially offset the changes in the cash flows of the expected fixed-rate bonds associated with the changes in the benchmark interest rate from the inception of the interest rate lock. Therefore, the interest rate lock is a hedging derivative instrument, and hedge accounting is applied. At the end of the subsequent reporting period, the city verifies that the critical terms have not changed.</div></body></html>
