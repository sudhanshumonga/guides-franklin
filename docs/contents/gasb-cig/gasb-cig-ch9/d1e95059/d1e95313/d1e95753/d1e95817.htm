Statement 44 eliminated a previous requirement to present a separate schedule because it repeated information already presented in other schedules. However, as long as a government meets the requirements of the Statement—specifically, that debt service be shown in its principal and interest components, and that the ratio be calculated as (total debt service ÷ total noncapital expenditures)—it does not matter whether the information appears in the same or a separate schedule. If a government presents a separate schedule, it would be helpful to include a note in the changes in fund balances schedule directing the reader to the debt service ratio information. (For example, see the note in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_I-7">Exhibit I-7</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B9-2, which directs the reader to the schedule in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_I-15">Exhibit I-15</span> of that Appendix.)</div></body></html>
