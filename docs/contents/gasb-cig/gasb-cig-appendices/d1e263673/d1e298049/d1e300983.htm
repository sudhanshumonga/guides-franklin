Internal service fund asset and liability balances that are not eliminated in the statement of net position should normally be reported in the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">governmental</b> activities column. Although internal service funds are reported as proprietary funds, the activities accounted for in them (the financing of goods and services for other funds of the government) are usually more governmental than business-type in nature. If enterprise funds are the predominant or only participants in an internal service fund, however, the government should report that internal service fund&#39;s residual assets and liabilities within the business-type activities column in the statement of net position.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Paragraph 314 in the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 34 explains what is meant by eliminating the &quot;effect&quot; of internal service fund activity.</div><div class="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_quoted_material_1">314. <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">In the statement of activities</b>, this Statement requires the elimination of the &quot;effect of internal service fund activity.&quot; In essence, eliminating the &quot;effect&quot; of internal service fund activity requires preparers to &quot;look back&quot; and adjust the internal service fund&#39;s internal charges to break even. Internal service fund net income would cause a pro rata <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">reduction</b> in the charges made to the participating funds/functions. Conversely, an internal service fund net loss would require a pro rata <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">increase</b> in the amounts charged to the participating funds/functions.</div><div class="ps_centered_heading_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_centered_heading_1">* * *</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">This exercise presents a comprehensive set of internal service funds and is intended to illustrate most of the allocation issues that governments might encounter. As a result, it portrays a more complex scenario and works through a more complicated solution than will likely be the case for most governments. <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">In addition, some amounts that could be considered immaterial may be used in this exercise to illustrate the types of adjustments that may be needed to allocate internal service fund results and balances.</b> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">No inferences about materiality should be drawn from this exercise</b>. For many governments, the internal service funds&#39; change in net position for the year will not be significant, and it will likely be sufficient to allocate any excess or deficiency to only the most active program(s) within the governmental activities category. Similarly, in many instances the amounts of interest income, expense, and outside transactions will be negligible and can be included in the &quot;look-back&quot; adjustments to the individual functions and programs.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The basic philosophy that internal service funds should break even—at least with regard to internal activity involving the separately reported functions and programs—guides the adjustment process. The overriding objective in &quot;eliminating the effects of internal service fund activity&quot; is to adjust the internal charges to cause a break-even result. For example, if a data-processing internal service fund reports a &quot;net income&quot; of $1,000, the participating programs&#39; direct expenses for data processing are overstated by that amount. The look-back adjustment &quot;refunds&quot; the overpayments to the programs (of course, no actual <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">cash </b>repayment is required, the adjustment is for financial reporting purposes only).</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Sometimes an internal service fund operation includes revenues and expenses that are not &quot;internal,&quot; or that deal with elements that are reported separately in the statement of activities. For example, investment income is generally reported separately in the general revenues section of the statement of activities; therefore, if an internal service fund has significant investment income, that amount should be included with investment income, rather than allocated among the various participating functions or programs. Similarly, interest expense is generally reported as a separate expense category in the statement of activities. Therefore, if an internal service fund has significant interest expense, that amount should be allocated to the interest expense line item, rather than the various functions or programs. In addition, significant revenues and expenses pertaining to transactions with outsiders are not part of the internal &quot;break-even&quot; initiative and would be reported as program revenues (charges for services) and direct expenses of the appropriate function or program.</div><div class="ps_tertiary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_tertiary_heading">Illustration</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">This exercise illustrates the application of the requirements in paragraph 59 of Statement 34 to eliminate the &quot;effect&quot; of internal service fund activity and similar internal events for the statement of activities. It also demonstrates how governments should report the assets and liabilities of internal service funds in the government-wide statement of net position as discussed in paragraph 62 of Statement 34, as amended.</div><div class="ps_para_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">In one case, enterprise funds are the only participants, whereas the other funds serve <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">both</b> enterprise and governmental funds.

Rather, the investment earnings should be combined with other investment earnings of business-type activities.

In this illustration, the data processing department is included in the general government functional category. The revenue ($186,350) should be included with charges for services (program revenue), and the expenses (sales less the 10% markup = $169,400, rounded) should be included with the direct expenses of the general government category.</div><div class="ps_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">c.Because all the internal service funds except the Utility Customer Services Fund are reported as governmental activities, the amounts allocated back to the enterprise functions (business-type activities) affect the internal balances.
