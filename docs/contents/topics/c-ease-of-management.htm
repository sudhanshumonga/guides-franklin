With fine-grained control, you can easily establish limits for administrators to slowly gain more responsibility throughout the <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> system. By enabling project managers and business owners to control their own workloads and resource allocation policies, users enjoy better service and the burden on cluster administrators is substantially reduced.</div><div id="p_y5d_33c_rr" class="p">An administrator can delegate specific sub-sets of rights to sub-administrators, with the ability to manage other users within their domain or to project owners with limited control over data resources within their domain.</div><div id="section_qkk_jbz_qr" class="section"><h2 class="title">Live customization </h2><div id="p_srn_33c_rr" class="p">Administrators can quickly and easily make changes to a wide range of <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> system parameters and <em class="term display-inline">ClusterView</em> reporting definitions and they can do so at any time “on the fly” without the need to restart cluster daemons. This means that you no longer have to wait for scheduled maintenance periods to make configuration changes to your cluster resources. This “live” reconfiguration capability boosts productivity, and minimizes downtime while reacting more swiftly to changing business priorities.</div></div></body></html>
