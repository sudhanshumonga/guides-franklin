All governments preparing a statistical section, with the exception of governments engaged only in fiduciary activities, are required to include a schedule of principal employers. Public colleges and universities should report the principal employers for the geographic area that is most relevant. For instance, a community college would report the largest employers in the locality, county, or region with which it is associated. A state-wide college or university likely would report the largest employers in its state, unless a smaller geographic area is more relevant.</div></body></html>
