Therefore, in the situation described in this question, the state should report as a sole employer. The school districts participating in the plan should report in accordance with the requirements of Statement 45, as amended, for cost-sharing employers and should apply the requirements of Statement 24, as amended, related to on-behalf payments for fringe benefits and salaries. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs24_par._8">Paragraph 8</span> of Statement 24 requires an employer for which on-behalf payments are made to recognize revenue equal to the amounts received by a third party and that are receivable at year-end for the current fiscal year. An employer that is not legally responsible for the payments is required to recognize expenditures/expense equal to the amount recognized as revenue. Employers should disclose in the notes to the financial statements the amounts recognized for on-behalf payments for fringe benefits and salaries. Employers for which on-behalf payments that are contributions to an OPEB plan are made should disclose the name of the plan that covers its employees and the name of the entity that makes the contributions. </div></body></html>
