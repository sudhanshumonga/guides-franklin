The PILOT is determined each year by multiplying the estimated assessed valuation of the water and sewer plant by the city&#39;s property tax rate. Should that transaction be reported as &quot;interfund services provided and used?&quot;</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The concept of &quot;interfund services provided and used&quot; implies an exchange or exchange-like transaction. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._112">Paragraph 112b</span> of Statement 34 requires internal PILOTs to be reported as transfers, rather than interfund services provided and used, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">unless the payments are reasonably equivalent in value to services provided.</b> </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The fact that the interfund charge is based on the normal tax rate is not relevant based on Statement 34. If the PILOT is calculated like a tax, rather than a bill for goods and services, it would not meet the criterion for revenue or expense treatment in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._112">paragraph 112a(2)</span>. Therefore, even though it still appears to be equivalent to charges to external organizations, it should be reported as a transfer because it is not exchange or exchange-like. Paragraph 52 in the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 33 discusses the nonexchange characteristic of taxes as follows: &quot;Although some may believe that property owners ‘exchange&#39; property taxes for certain services, such as public safety and sanitation, there is no direct relationship between the values provided by homeowners (taxes paid) and the services provided; the tax generally is not based on the cost or value of the services.&quot;</div></body></html>
