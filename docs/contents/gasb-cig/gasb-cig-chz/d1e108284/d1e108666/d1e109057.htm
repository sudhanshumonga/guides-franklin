Example 1 in nonauthoritative Appendix D of Statement 33 illustrates that the amount to be accrued will likely be based on merchants&#39; sales reported <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">or estimated.</b> Thus, the accrual is not limited to the data in merchants&#39; sales reports and may involve additional estimates if actual data are not available. Example 1 further illustrates that the amount accrued will be based on sales data for the weeks or quarters that make up the government&#39;s fiscal year. Even if the quarters covered by merchants&#39; sales reports do not coincide with the quarters of the government&#39;s fiscal year, year-end accruals are still required.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#example_2__hotel_tax_rec1">Examples 2 and 3</span> of that nonauthoritative appendix discuss similar practical considerations that may result in yearly recognition of hotel taxes and income taxes.
