Depending on the way that premiums are assigned to active employees and to retirees or terminated employees in the group, the employer may be contributing part of the total cost of coverage for retirees or terminated employees. This would generally be the case, for example, if blended premium rates are assigned to all members of the group, and the employer pays all or part of the blended premium rates for active employees. The employer&#39;s contribution for postemployment healthcare should be measured as the difference between the claims costs, or age-adjusted premiums approximating claims costs, for retirees or terminated employees in the group and those members&#39; contributions (counting as member contributions the amounts paid on behalf of terminated employees by the employer or a third-party administrator from the individual sick leave conversion accounts).
