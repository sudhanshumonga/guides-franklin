A government may have a nonmajor fund with an investment that is exposed to interest rate risk. Depending upon the magnitude of the investment's interest rate risk as related to the total interest rate risk of the aggregated nonmajor funds (for example, nonmajor governmental funds) and the primary government, the government may be required to report the interest rate risk of the aggregated nonmajor funds in accordance with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#level_of_detail_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-op#level_of_detail_rec1">paragraph 5</span> of Statement 40. Disclosures for nonmajor funds should be made if the risk within the aggregated nonmajor fund total is significantly greater than the interest rate risk of the primary government. For example, a government may hold a variable-rate investment with a coupon set at 1.5 times the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in a nonmajor special revenue fund. If this investment's risk exposure is significant to the total of aggregated governmental nonmajor funds and the primary government's interest rate risk exposure as a whole is significantly less than that of the aggregated governmental nonmajor funds, the appropriate interest rate risk disclosures should be made for the aggregated governmental nonmajor funds.</div></body></html>
