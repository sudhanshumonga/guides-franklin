Neither Statement 34 nor Statement 35 specifically requires a special-purpose government engaged only in business-type activities to report using either natural or functional classifications. It should be noted that <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._11">paragraph 11b(7)</span> of Statement 34 requires condensed financial information for the current and prior years to be presented as &quot;program expenses, at a minimum by function&quot; when included in MD&amp;A. However, paragraph 138a of Statement 34 indicates that <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._8">paragraphs 8–11</span>, as amended, apply to special-purpose governments engaged only in business-type activities &quot;as appropriate.&quot; Therefore, if an organization reports its expenses using natural classifications, the comparative information in MD&amp;A should be presented in the same manner as that included in the basic financial statements.</div></body></html>
