The sample DITA files that have been prepared are intended to provide illustrative DITA content that is both technically valid and functionally realistic. It primary use-case is as a tool for demonstrating the capabilities of DITA to audiences that are interested in the functional benefits that can be achieved by deploying DITA.</div><div class="p">The content has been created based on materials produced by various organizations with this content being modified to exclude proprietary details.</div><div class="p">The functional objective set for the content itself is that it should be &quot;functionally realistic&quot; without necessarily being a flawless description of an actual system. As a technical objective, the DITA markup is valid and inline with generally accepted DITA markup practices. As a further objective, the DITA markup intentionally includes a range of possible markup and content organization tactics, based on patterns encountered in real-world content sources.</div><div class="p">The collection of instances provided as part of this collection is also intended to be broad enough to support the definition and execution of a number of useful demonstration scenarios.</div><div class="p">For this initial DITA Demonstration Collection, it was determined that the focus would be placed squarely upon the use and demonstration of core DITA 1.2 features. The DITA Demonstration Collection will be updated and extended over time to reflect newly released DITA features as they become available and as they enter mainstream usage.</div><h2 class="title">Using the Collection</h2><div class="p">The initial DITA Demonstration Collection has been prepared based on a general story that features a software product that facilitates the management of a distributed collection of hardware devices and software components. The fictional system has been called the <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> solution which includes a user environment named <em class="term display-inline">MobileView</em>. This scenario was developed because it makes it possible to illustrate many of the core DITA benefits such as supporting the publication of a range of information products for a variety of user types and across a number of product releases. It also makes it possible to introduce new collections of content that would add new types of content (e.g., hardware documentation, business procedures, and so on).</div><div class="p">If there is a governing purpose for the DITA Demonstration Collection, it is to serve as a set of sample files that can be used to demonstrate the capabilities and benefits of different DITA enabled technologies and by extension DITA itself. More generally still, this collection of sample files can be used to introduce stakeholders to the merits of applying carefully designed markup structures to their content assets. It is this purpose that makes the functional realism of the &quot;story&quot; so important. Even where it is not a match to what a given group of stakeholders is interested in directly, it should nonetheless look realistic and credible. In seeking to be this, it is hoped that the story surrounding for <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em>, and its various subcomponents, will support a wide range of demonstration, training, and evaluation scenarios that will be broadly accessible.</div><div class="p">One of the key target demonstration scenarios set for the <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> collection is to showcase how quickly important details, such as product names or widely used resources (i.e., icons), can be changed and immediately propagated across the entire collection and across all resulting information products. This capability can be used to quickly modify the <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> collection to use different company and product names, and to invoke different icons and images, so that in very short order the collection could look more like information produced or used by a given audience. </div><div class="section"><h2 class="title">Licensing Terms</h2><div class="p">Copyright 2015 Gnostyx Research Inc.</div><div class="p">Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the &quot;License&quot;); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

A key one is that the development of good quality content is very hard work and that this is made even harder when the task of constructing a fictional, but still functionally realistic, story is tossed into the mix. It should be expected that the coherence of the story, and the consistency with which it is realized, will continue to be improved although this claim will need to be measured against the fact that this represents the most challenging aspect of such an undertaking.</div><div class="p">Anyone using or reviewing this collection who identifies any issues or who has comments that would point towards the improvement of the collection can forward their observations to Gnostyx Research Inc. (<span class="msgph ph display-inline">info@gnostyx.com</span>). These improvement observations can, naturally, include contributions of additional sample instances. This collection will also be deployed on a publically accessible source control service (GitHub) thereby facilitating its collaborative evolution.</div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title">Organization of content </h2><div class="p">All topics, maps, graphics, and ditaval files (to control conditions) are available in one folder. </div><div class="p">If it is desireable to test a different situations where files are located in various sibling folders or subfolders, implementers can copy a map, as well as all its topics and graphics, into sibling or sub-folders, then rename the copied map and adding it to the master map.<div class="note"><div><div><span class="prefix-content">Note: </span></div></div><div class="p"><div><span>Implementers may need to troubleshoot filenames and duplicate reference files for content that has content references.</span></div></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title">Variables</h2><div class="p">Company, product, and features names are controlled through a central file: <span class="filepath ph display-inline">r_productname_variables.dita</span>. </div><div class="p">When a company, product, or feature name is included in the content, it is placed in the target file as a conref or conkeyref from the central file (source). This permits the values to be modified, or extended, whenever needed (if the company name changes, product name changes, or feature name changes). Maintaining variables centrally is particularly useful in the case of a collection of test and demonstration instances because it should make it easy to change key names in order, for example, to reflect a particular organizations product names. Implementers making use of the collection, or the team maintaining the collection, may wish to:<ul id="ul_adg_dci_le" class="ul"><li class="li"><div class="p">Modify the names used for the product, company or features in order to tailor the demonstrations to reflect the needs of a given organization.</div></li><li class="li"><div class="p">Extend the content collection to include new products or features.</div></li><li class="li"><div class="p">Extend the content collection to support scenarios where two or more companies are contributing content to a combined product.</div></li></ul>In a similar fashion, an image warehouse topic (<span class="filepath ph display-inline">r_image_warehouse.dita</span>) has been used to hold references to the images being used by the collection.</div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title">Guide to the Maps</h2><div class="p"><h3>The roles of the different Maps provided as part of the DITA Demonstration Collection</h3><div class="table-headcount-1"><div><div><div class="p">Map</div></div><div><div class="p">Scenario</div></div></div><div><div><div class="p">Master Control Map</div></div><div><div class="p">This map provides a single view of all topics within the collection.
