The bonds are a liability of the county, but the building will be reported as an asset of the component unit. The county disburses funds to the component unit to pay for construction costs as they are incurred. At year-end, the county has unspent bond proceeds. Should the county account for the unspent proceeds in an <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">agency</b> fund? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. In substance, the county&#39;s financing of the component unit&#39;s construction is similar to an expenditure-driven grant. The amounts paid to the component unit, and construction costs incurred but not yet reimbursed, represent the amount of the grant for the year. The unearned portion—the unspent proceeds—is an asset of the county.</div></body></html>
