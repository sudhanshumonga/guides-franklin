The provisions in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#discrete_presentation_of_component_units_rec1">paragraphs 44, 50, and 51</span> of Statement 14, as amended, regarding the mechanics of discrete presentation, are intended to provide flexible guidance. Paragraph 51, as amended, permits governments to present major component units in separate columns (and rows) in the government-wide statements. In addition, component units could be presented based on functional groupings, whether component units are governmental or business type, or whether the primary government is financially accountable based on fiscal dependency and a financial benefit or burden relationship. However, segregating component units into functional groupings in the government-wide statements does not relieve the government of the major component unit reporting responsibility—either in combining statements or in condensed financial statements in the notes.</div></body></html>
