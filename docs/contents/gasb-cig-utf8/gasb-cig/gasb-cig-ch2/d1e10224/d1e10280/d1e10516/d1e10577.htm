A statement of cash flows should be presented for all proprietary funds even if operating income is zero. Transactions other than those resulting in operating income create cash flows that should be presented in the statement of cash flows. If there is no operating income or loss for the periods the reconciliation of operating income to net cash flow from operating activities would begin with zero. Adjustments and reconciling items should be presented as additions to and deductions from zero to arrive at the amount of net cash flow from operating activities.</div></body></html>
