To help answer some of them, please review the following content.</span></div></div></div><div id="id169UAN0A0XB" class="topic" data-attr-xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/"><h1 class="title">What business opportunities does owning a spaceship bring?</h1><div class="shortdesc"><div><div><span>Very specific business models are available to owners of a spaceship. However, buying a spaceship with the express goal of turning a quick profit is not suggested.</span></div></div></div><p class="p">Many businesses are interested in spaceflight. This includes space tourism, as well as delivery of cargo to space. The cost per pound is steep. At over $1000/lb the cost to send an average person into space can cost as much as some homes!</p><p class="p">You can also send equipment into space. For example, many companies deliver satellites into space. The costs for this are similar, but can be recovered by businesses.</p><p class="p">Not all costs are measured by weight though, so a thorough examination of the costs should be done. If you aren’t sure if you can afford a spaceship without renting out room on it for trips, then you can’t afford a spaceship!</p></div><div id="id169UB000EOU" class="topic" data-attr-xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/"><h1 class="title">Can we connect with the International Space Station?</h1><div class="shortdesc"><div><div><span>Yes, however, special accommodations must be made well in advance.</span></div></div></div><p class="p">The International Space Station (ISS) is an international spaceship that is home to multiple astronauts performing a broad range of science experiments. Therefore, it’s important that before planning to dock, permissions are acquired.</p><p class="p">For more informations, contact your space agency.</p></div><div id="id169UB00306V" class="topic" data-attr-xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/"><h1 class="title">How much does a spaceship cost?</h1><div class="shortdesc"><div><div><span>Specific configurations vary, but generally, the cost is measured in billions of dollars. While this cost will decrease over time, it’s a small price to pay to be able to travel into space.</span></div></div></div><p class="p">The core vehicle costs are between $1.3 and $1.5 billion. Additional costs which vary from one launch to the next include the costs of fuel, consumables, and crew.</p><p class="p">There is also the fixed cost of a takeoff and landing site, unless you rent space from one of the space agencies that have such facilities.</p><p class="p">Another cost to consider is the ongoing costs of connecting to the International Space Station.</p></div><div id="id169UB00L0AT" class="topic" data-attr-xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/"><h1 class="title">How long do I have to wait for delivery?</h1><div class="shortdesc"><div><div><span>Based on multiple factors, the time from your order confirmation until delivery could be between 6 months and 2 years.</span></div></div></div><p class="p">Factors include the location of your launch site, the type of vehicle and options ordered, and build time.</p></div><div id="id169UB010FN8" class="topic" data-attr-xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/"><h1 class="title">What fuels the vehicle at takeoff?</h1><div class="shortdesc"><div><div><span>The initial launch is powered by 2 solid fuel boosters and a main tank.</span></div></div></div><p class="p">Both boosters contain a mix of substances:</p><div class="table-headcount-1"><div><div>Item</div><div>Function</div><div>Volume/amount</div></div><div><div>ammonium perchlorate</div><div>oxidizer</div><div>69.8% by weight</div></div><div><div>atomized aluminium powder</div><div>fuel</div><div>16%</div></div><div><div>iron oxide</div><div>catalyst</div><div>0.2%</div></div><div><div>PBAN</div><div>binder/fuel</div><div>12%</div></div><div><div>epoxy curing agent</div><div></div><div>2%</div></div></div><p></p><p class="p">The main tank contains primarily liquid oxygen oxidizer and liquid hydrogen as fuel.</p></div><div id="id169UAN009OZ" class="topic" data-attr-xmlns:ditaarch="http://dita.oasis-open.org/architecture/2005/"><h1 class="title">How does a ‘washroom’ work in space?</h1><div class="shortdesc"><div><div><span>We get asked about this a LOT! In space there are different ways to shower, brush your teeth, or go to the bathroom, but all the same things can be done.</span></div></div></div><p class="p">Personal hygiene is important. All washrooms are used by any gender and have air flowing or vacuum to draw in materials. There is no shower, but sponge baths are possible (and encouraged) in space.</p><p class="p">Toilets use air and vacuums and solid materials are compressed and stored, then removed after landing. Wastewater is recycled and reused, but not for drinking.</p><p class="p">Air is filtered to remove any smells and bacteria and can cycle through the cabin and continue to be breathed.</p></div></body></html>
