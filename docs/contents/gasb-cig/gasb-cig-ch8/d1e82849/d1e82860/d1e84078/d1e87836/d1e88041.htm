Accordingly, any unpaid contractually required contributions for pay periods falling within a cost-sharing employer&#39;s financial reporting period at the end of that period should be considered &quot;expected to be liquidated with expendable available financial resources,&quot; for modified accrual recognition purposes, and should be recognized as governmental fund liabilities, regardless of the date on which payment is required to be made. For example, as of June 30, 20X5, the employer in Question 8.41.6 has not yet paid to the plan the contractually required contribution assessed for the pay period June 20X5. (Payment will be made on a date after June 30.) The employer should account for the unpaid contribution as a liability (expected to be liquidated with expendable available financial resources) and as a component of OPEB expenditures (in addition to the amounts contributed to the plan, as discussed in Question 8.41.6) in governmental fund financial statements for the year ended June 30, 20X5. Note that the contractually required contribution paid in July 20X5 for the pay period June 20X4 was not a contribution to the plan <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">for the current financial reporting period, </b>as discussed in Question 8.41.6, but was recognized as a liability and an expenditure of the employer&#39;s <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">previous financial reporting period</b> ended June 30, 20X4.
