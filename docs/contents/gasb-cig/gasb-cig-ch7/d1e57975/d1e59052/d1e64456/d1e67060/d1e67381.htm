The payments from the other funds are recorded as revenue in a general fund account called &quot;interfund charges.&quot; Should that &quot;revenue&quot; be eliminated for the statement of activities, or does it constitute program revenue of the general government function? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._112">Paragraph 112a(2)</span> of Statement 34 defines interfund services provided and used as sales and purchases of goods and services between funds for a price approximating their external exchange value. It also states that interfund services provided and used should be reported as revenues in seller funds and expenditures or expenses in purchaser funds. The paragraph defines interfund reimbursements as repayments from the funds responsible for particular expenditures or expenses to the funds that initially paid for them. It further stipulates that reimbursements should not be displayed in the financial statements.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#internal_activities_statement_of_activities_rec1">Paragraph 59</span> of Statement 34 requires reimbursement-type activity to be eliminated for the statement of activities, so that the allocated (reimbursed) expenses are reported only by the function to which they were allocated. Conversely, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._60">paragraph 60</span> of the Statement <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">prohibits</b> the elimination of interfund services provided and used. The interfund activity described in this question meets the definition of a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">reimbursement.</b> (See Question 7.47.12.) Therefore, the government should not display the &quot;revenue,&quot; but should instead reduce the appropriate expenses (in the function from which they were initially paid) for the reimbursed amounts. This process in effect &quot;eliminates&quot; the interfund activity for the statement of activities.</div></body></html>
