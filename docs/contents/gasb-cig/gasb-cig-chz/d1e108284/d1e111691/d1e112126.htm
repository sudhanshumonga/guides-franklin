For example, the specific objective of a research project at a medical university may be the development of a patent related to the creation of a new material for stitches formed from a combination of specific microfibers. Determination of the nature of service capacity expected to be provided by the intangible asset should, at a minimum, be at a broad qualitative level. For example, in the case of the project to develop a new stitch material discussed above, the nature of the service capacity could be the improvement of services provided to patients of the university’s hospital. The nature of the service capacity does not have to be quantifiable, for example, in a number of service units. </div></body></html>
