More significant upgrades to the software, such as an upgrade to a new version of the software, are not covered under this contract, and the government is charged for them separately. How should the government account for the outlays associated with the maintenance contract?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>External modifications of computer software should be capitalized if they result in an increase in functionality or efficiency of the computer software or an extension of the estimated useful life of the software. Therefore, conceptually, the outlays of the maintenance contract should be allocated between upgrades that result in one of the aforementioned outcomes (capitalizable) and all other upgrades and maintenance provided by the vendor (expensed as incurred). However, depending on the materiality of the outlays related to the unspecified upgrades, as a practical matter, a government may choose to establish a policy that all unspecified upgrades should be considered maintenance and, accordingly, expense the associated outlays as incurred. </div></body></html>
