Five years later, the state legislature passes a new, equally enforceable law that again authorizes the tax but changes the purpose for which those tax revenues can be used. Are the components of net position generated by the tax under the new law restricted?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes, as long as the legislation establishing the new restriction qualifies as enabling legislation, as defined by paragraph 34 of Statement 34, as amended. The components of net position resulting from taxes raised under the new law are restricted for the new purpose from that period forward. Professional judgment should be used to determine if the components of net position resulting from taxes raised under the initial enabling legislation should remain restricted for the original purpose, or should henceforth be reported as restricted to the new purpose specified in the new legislation, or unrestricted.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._327">Paragraph 327</span> of the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 34 emphasizes the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">substance</b> of the legislation as the determining factor when considering whether components of net position are restricted. If resources are indeed restricted by virtue of a legally enforceable and binding action of the legislature, the substance is the same, regardless of whether the limitations were imposed in the initial enabling legislation or in subsequently enacted enabling legislation that replaces the original legislation. The substance is that resources are being held pursuant to legally enforceable, binding restrictions. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#restricted_net_assets_rec1">Paragraph 34</span> of Statement 34, as amended, would consider those resources restricted.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">In this illustration, the new enabling legislation does not restrict the use of previously unrestricted resources, nor does it simply “earmark” the original revenue source. In those instances, the accumulated resources would be <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">unrestricted</b> rather than <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">restricted.</b> (See also Question 7.24.11.) Rather, like the original legislation, the new legislation meets the criteria for being considered enabling legislation, including providing the authority to raise the revenue that is restricted. In this way, as noted in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#new_enabling_legislation_that_establishes_different_restrictions_rec1">paragraph 24</span> of the Basis for Conclusions of Statement 46, the new legislation replaces the original in its entirety, and the original enabling legislation is no longer in effect.</div></body></html>
