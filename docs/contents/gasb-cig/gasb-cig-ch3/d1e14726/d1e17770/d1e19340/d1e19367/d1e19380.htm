If IBNR claims are probable and reasonably estimable, they are required to be included in the total unpaid claims accrual. Therefore, they should be included in the reconciliation of unpaid claims liabilities. In addition, the expected future development on existing claims, which is another component of IBNR, should be included in the total unpaid claims accrual and, accordingly, in the reconciliation of unpaid claims liabilities. If, however, IBNR claims are disclosed only, in accordance with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#disclosure_of_loss_contingencies_1_rec1">paragraph 58</span>, because of an inability to estimate the amount or because claims are only reasonably possible and, thus, are not included as liabilities on the statement of net position/balance sheet, this reconciliation would not include them either. However, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">IBNR claims generally are estimable.</b> </div></body></html>
