The agency is authorized by state law to borrow funds necessary to carry out its operations and the state is not responsible for debts of the agency. However, the State Bond Commission, a component unit of the state, is required to approve all issuances of tax-exempt debt within the state by &quot;any person or entity, public or private.&quot; In the past, as part of its approval process, the State Bond Commission instructed the agency to reevaluate a proposed debt issuance and did not approve the issuance until the amount of the debt was lowered in accordance with its guidelines.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The insurance guarantee agency would not be a component unit of the state. The state does not appoint the governing board of the agency. Therefore, the agency would only be a component unit if it is fiscally dependent on the state and there is a potential for the organization to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burdens on, the primary government or if the agency meets the criteria for inclusion under Statement 39. The approval authority of the State Bond Commission applies to all issuances of tax-exempt debt, public and private. It would be appropriate to characterize the approval authority as ministerial or compliance-oriented in nature. Therefore, the fiscal independence of the agency would not be affected by the oversight role of the State Bond Commission. The criteria in Statement 39, which would require inclusion, are not met.</div></body></html>
