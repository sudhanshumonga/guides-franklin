The governing board of the authority is appointed by a city official. The city is not able to impose its will on the authority, because the board members may be removed only for cause. However, the requirement that the housing authority make payments in lieu of taxes provides a financial benefit to the city because there is no indication that there is a direct relationship between the payments made and the cost of specific services provided to the authority by the city. Therefore, the city is financially accountable for the housing authority. The two boards are not substantively the same. The services of the authority are provided to the residents of the city rather than to the city itself, and the total debt outstanding, including leases, of the authority is not expected to be repaid entirely or almost entirely with resources of the city; therefore, the authority would not meet the criteria for blending and should be discretely presented.</div></body></html>
