However, the Statement does not specify how to measure the number of employees. Governments should use professional judgment to select a measure that best suits the needs of the user of their financial reports. Governments also should use a consistent measure from year to year and should clearly describe what type of information they are presenting and note any methods or assumptions used to derive the information.</div></body></html>
