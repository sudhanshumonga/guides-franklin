Paragraph 88 of Statement 62 states that a correction of an error should be reported as a prior period adjustment. Consistent with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_footnote_13">footnote 13</span> of Statement 34, as amended, governments should implement that requirement by either displaying the amount on the face of the statement as an adjustment to <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">beginning net position/fund balance, as previously reported,</b> or by displaying <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">beginning net position/fund balances, as restated,</b> with an explanation of the restatement in the notes to the financial statements. When comparative statements are presented, corresponding adjustments should be made to the transactions and balances for all periods presented to incorporate the retroactive application of the prior period adjustments, as discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb_op_gasb_62_par__61">paragraph 61</span> of Statement 62, as amended.</div></body></html>
