Between the date the dividend is declared and the ex-dividend date, the market price (fair value) of the equity security includes the value of the declared dividends. Because the equity security is reported at fair value, recognizing the dividends receivable and revenue for financial reporting purposes before the ex-dividend date would duplicate the transaction.</div></body></html>
