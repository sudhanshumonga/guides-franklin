That is, it identifies the number, functions, and location of the employees to be terminated, as well as when the terminations will occur. In addition, the plan is sufficiently detailed to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated. Because the plan has a future service requirement, the city is required by paragraph 15 of Statement 47 to recognize a liability and expense for the involuntary termination benefits ratably over the period from the point in time when the plan was approved and communicated and the amounts could be estimated (March 31, 20X1) to the end of the required future service period (September 30, 20X1). Therefore, in financial statements for the year ended June 30, 20X1, the employer should recognize a pro rata portion of the liability and expense for the costs related to the 20 employees. Because the termination plan is directly associated with a disposal of government operations, only termination costs recognized subsequent to June 30, 20X1, would be included in the gain or loss from the disposal of operations as of September 30, 20X1, in accordance with footnote 7 to paragraph 53a of Statement No. 69, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Government Combinations and Disposals of Government Operations.</b> </div></body></html>
