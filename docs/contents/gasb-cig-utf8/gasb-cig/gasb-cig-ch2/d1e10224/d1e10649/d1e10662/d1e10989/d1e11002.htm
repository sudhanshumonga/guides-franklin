The two are mutually exclusive. The Statement 9 definition of a cash equivalent overlaps the definitions of deposits and investments. A cash equivalent, when evaluated for Statement 3 and 40 purposes, is either a deposit or an investment. That is, a 60-day certificate of deposit is a deposit with a financial institution, and a Treasury bill purchased 60 days before its maturity is an investment. But for cash flow reporting purposes, both qualify as cash equivalents because their original maturities are three months or less. The fact that a cash equivalent is a deposit or an investment has no effect on the presentation of the statement of cash flows.</div></body></html>
