If all of a government&#39;s direct rates apply to the same proportion of the revenue base, the rates may simply be summed. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">However, governments with rates that apply to only a portion of the revenue base, or that set differential rates for different types of property or transactions or customers, will need to employ a formula for calculating a weighted average that multiplies each rate by the proportion of the revenue base to which it applies. (An example calculation of the total direct rate appears in nonauthoritative Appendix B9-3.)</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If a government has a complex rate structure that would make such a calculation extremely difficult (or impossible if the revenue base cannot be sufficiently disaggregated for each applicable rate), then the government may substitute an effective tax rate instead. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_question_49">Question 9.18.1</span>.) The effective tax rate should be clearly labeled and presented in both the revenue base and revenue rate schedules; governments could present a note explaining why effective tax rates are presented rather than total direct rates.</div></body></html>
