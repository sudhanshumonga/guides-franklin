The operating activities category is not limited to the cash flows resulting from operating income items. Unless the cash flows specifically meet the definition of the noncapital financing, capital and related financing, or investing activities category, they should be presented in the residual category—operating activities. If nonoperating income items, such as miscellaneous income or expense, are included in the operating activities category, an adjustment should be made to operating income in the reconciliation of operating income to net cash flow from operating activities.
