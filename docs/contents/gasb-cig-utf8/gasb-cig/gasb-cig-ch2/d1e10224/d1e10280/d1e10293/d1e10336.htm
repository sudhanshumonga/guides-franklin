However, the balances and transactions of <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">blended</b> component units are included as if they were balances and transactions of the primary government itself. Therefore, if a component unit is "blended" as an enterprise fund, a statement of cash flows would be required for that fund, either presented separately as a major fund or aggregated with other nonmajor enterprise funds. </div></body></html>
