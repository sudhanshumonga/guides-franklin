The carrying value of the liens on the city’s books is $110,000 ($130,000 less an allowance of $20,000). The city does not retain a residual interest in the receivables. If the agreement does not meet the criteria to be reported as a sale of receivables, how should the city report the transaction? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>The proceeds received ($100,000) should be reported as a liability. The receivables should remain on the city’s books, but their carrying value should be reduced to $100,000 to recognize that the $10,000 difference is uncollectible. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs48_par_12">Paragraph 12</span> of Statement 48 provides that receivables collected and paid to the transferee after the liability has been liquidated should be reported as expenses/expenditures when the pledging government (the city) becomes obligated to make the payments. The city becomes obligated to make the payments when the excess receivables are collected. Therefore, if additional collections are made after the liability is liquidated, the city simultaneously should recognize cash and revenue (recovery of amounts previously considered uncollectible) and an expense/expenditure and a liability (for the amount owed to the transferee).</div></body></html>
