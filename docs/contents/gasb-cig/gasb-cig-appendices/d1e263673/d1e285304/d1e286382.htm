Several parents formed a group and hired a music instructor who was not an employee of the school district. In addition, the parents&#39; group entered into an agreement with the district to rent classroom space after school hours to hold the music lessons. The parents share the expenses of the program based on a per-child allocation of the total cost. The rental payments made to the school district were insignificant to the district.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>The music program is not a component unit of the school district because the parents&#39; group that established the after-school music program did not separately incorporate or apply for tax exemption. Thus, there is no &quot;organization&quot; to which the three criteria for inclusion would be applied.</div></body></html>
