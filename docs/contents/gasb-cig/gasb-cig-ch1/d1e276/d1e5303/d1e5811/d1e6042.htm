Is this an investment with a fair value that is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—A variable-rate investment with a multiplier may be considered to be an investment with a fair value that is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates because small changes in interest rates will be amplified by the underlying multiplier. These larger changes in the coupon payment affect the amount of future cash flows to be received by the holder of the bond, which consequently affects the fair value of the investment. Whereas variable-rate investments usually reprice back to par on interest rate reset dates, the fair value of variable-rate investments with multipliers may significantly change depending on the nature of the multiplier. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._16">Paragraph 16a</span> of Statement 40 identifies a variable-rate investment that has a coupon based on 1.25 times the 3-month LIBOR rate as a highly sensitive investment. However, a variable-rate investment with a coupon rate set at 1.05 times the 3-month LIBOR would not necessarily qualify for the same categorization considering that the effect of the multiplier, while present, may not greatly impact the fair value of the investment.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Additionally, consideration needs to be made regarding whether the simple multiplier causes the instrument to take on the characteristics of an inverse floater. Paragraph 16b of Statement 40 identifies one such inverse floater as a highly sensitive investment.
