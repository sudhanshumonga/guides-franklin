The board of the foundation is not appointed by the university. The foundation regularly makes distributions directly to the university and pays for the maintenance of the university&#39;s football stadium and auditorium (by making payments directly to vendors and contractors rather than the university). Separately, the direct cash payments to the university and the maintenance expenses of the university paid by the foundation are not significant to the university—combined, however, they are significant. The economic resources of the foundation that are restricted for the benefit of the university are significant.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion: </b>CCB University Foundation is a component unit of the university and should be discretely presented in the university&#39;s reporting entity financial statements. The language in the foundation&#39;s bylaws satisfies the &quot;direct benefit&quot; criterion, and the &quot;entitlement/ability to access&quot; criterion is met due to the foundation&#39;s history of supporting the university. The &quot;significance&quot; criterion is met because the combined resources used by university activities and the restricted resources held by the foundation are deemed to be significant to the university, regardless of the extent to which those resources may be used for &quot;in-kind&quot; assistance to the university.</div></body></html>
