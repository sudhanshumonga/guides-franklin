Unlike a single-employer or agent multiple-employer plan, in which each employer retains sole responsibility for funding benefits for its own group, a cost-sharing plan involves a pooling, or sharing, of benefit obligations and assets. In addition to performing administrative functions, the plan assumes from the individual employers the responsibility and risk associated with the funding of benefits for the whole group. In exchange for the services provided and the assumption of risk by the plan, the individual cost-sharing employers incur liabilities to the plan for the contractually required contributions assessed by the plan for specified periods. The use of the term emphasizes that for cost-sharing employers, the measurement of expense or expenditures is not required to be based on the ARC but should be based on the amount assessed by the plan, however determined.</div></body></html>
