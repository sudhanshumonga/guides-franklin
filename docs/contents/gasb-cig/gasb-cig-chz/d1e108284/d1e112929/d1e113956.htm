That decision can only be reversed or modified by the government taking the same action. The conditions under which the resources can be used are sufficiently prescriptive to be reported as committed fund balance. Can the Budgetary Stabilization Fund be reported as a special revenue fund?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. Because the foundation of the separate fund is a specific committed revenue source , it can be reported as a special revenue fund, provided that the revenues are recognized in the separate fund. </div></body></html>
