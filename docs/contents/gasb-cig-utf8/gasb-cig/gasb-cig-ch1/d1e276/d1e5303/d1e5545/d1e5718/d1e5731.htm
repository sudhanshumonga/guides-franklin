Sensitivity analysis models express potential loss in future income, fair values, or cash flows from hypothetical changes in interest rates. An example of a sensitivity analysis model is a shock or stress test in which interest rates across a yield curve are assumed to simultaneously increase. An illustration of such a disclosure is provided in nonauthoritative <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_appendix_B1-2illustration_7_interest_rate_risk_simulation_model__rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_appendix_B1-2illustration_7_interest_rate_risk_simulation_model__rec1">Appendix B1-2, Illustration 7</span>. A VaR model expresses potential loss in future income, fair values, or cash flows over a selected period of time with a selected likelihood of occurrence from changing interest rates. Examples of VaR models are variance/co-variance, historical simulation, and Monte Carlo simulation. The variance/co-variance model, for example, relies on statistical relationships to describe how changes in different markets can affect a portfolio of instruments with different characteristics and market exposures.</div></body></html>
