The discrete column(s) should be located to the right of the financial data of the primary government, with descriptive headings to allow readers to distinguish between the financial data of the primary government (including its blended component units) and those of the discretely presented component units. In addition to the columns in the statement of activities, discrete row(s) should be located below the function/program details of the primary government to provide for that distinction.
