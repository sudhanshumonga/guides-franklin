An individual cost-sharing employer might, for example, incur an OPEB-related debt to the plan for its past service costs at the time the employer enters the cost-sharing plan or for contractually required contributions assessed for one or more pay periods that the employer arranges with the plan to pay on an installment basis with interest. In financial statements prepared on the accrual basis of accounting, the employer should recognize an expense and a liability in the full amount of the OPEB-related debt in the year that it incurs the debt. The unpaid debt at the end of each period should be reported as a liability separate from any OPEB liability or asset resulting from a difference between contractually required contributions required and contributions made.</div></body></html>
