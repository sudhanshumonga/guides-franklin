For example, the nature and usage of patents differs from that of right-of-way easements such that they should not be aggregated in the same major class of capital assets. However, multiple types of intangible assets that have a similar nature and usage could be combined to form a major class of capital asset. For example, water rights, mineral rights, and timber rights might be combined to form a land use rights major class of capital assets. Additionally, a single type of intangible asset, for example, water rights or computer software, may be considered a major class of capital assets depending on its significance to the government’s total amount of capital assets. </div></body></html>
