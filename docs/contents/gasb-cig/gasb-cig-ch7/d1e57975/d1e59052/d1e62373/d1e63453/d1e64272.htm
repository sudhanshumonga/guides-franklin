For example, should unrestricted net position of a water utility fund be considered “restricted to water utility operations” when that fund is combined with other funds to comprise business-type activities in the government-wide statements? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Even though a statute, ordinance, or rate-payer agreement may limit the use of water fund revenues to water fund purposes, net position in the government-wide statements should be classified as they are in the enterprise fund financial statements. Because the business-type activities reporting unit in government-wide statements does not have a “purpose,” per se, the issue of whether resources in an individual enterprise fund can only be used for a narrower purpose should not be considered.
