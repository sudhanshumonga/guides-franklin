Therefore, because the budgetary comparison schedule can only include major special revenue funds that have legally adopted budgets, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">any special revenue fund presented is a major fund,</b> regardless of whether it otherwise would be required to be reported as a major fund pursuant to the percentage criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._76">paragraph 76</span>, as amended. Thus, the consequence of presenting additional special revenue funds in the budgetary comparison schedule is that those funds are subject to all major fund reporting requirements and are, therefore, not considered nonmajor.</div></body></html>
