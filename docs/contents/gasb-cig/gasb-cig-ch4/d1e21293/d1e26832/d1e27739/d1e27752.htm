For example, an investment pool generally has &#39;open&#39; membership; that is, governments are free to join, resign, and increase or decrease their participation in the pool without the knowledge or consent of the other participants. Furthermore, a participant&#39;s equity interest in the pool (for example, its share of investments in an investment pool) should already be recognized in its financial statements; thus, calculating and reporting an equity interest as defined in paragraph 72 would be redundant. . . .&quot;</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">For example, a state may sponsor an investment pool for all local governments within the state. Each local government is able to manage their level of participation without consent of other participating governments, and therefore, this arrangement would meet the definition of a pool.</div></body></html>
