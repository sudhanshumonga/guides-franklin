The provisions of the TIF agreement are (a) bonds are issued by the government to finance infrastructure improvements in a specific geographic area; (b) a baseline for sales tax revenues for the geographic area, including the proposed development, is established prior to the start of the project; and (c) the additional sales tax revenues above the baseline are specifically set aside for the payment of the bonds. Do the requirements of Statement 77 apply to this TIF agreement?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. This arrangement does not meet the definition of a tax abatement under Statement 77 for several reasons. It is not an agreement with an individual or entity. Consequently, there are no individuals or entities that are required to perform any actions. Furthermore, the TIF agreement does not result in a reduction of the government’s tax revenues. Rather, the additional tax revenues in the TIF area are earmarked for debt service on the bonds. It should be noted that the name of the transaction is not relevant to the determination of whether it is a tax abatement for financial reporting purposes. A transaction entitled <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">TIF, Payment in Lieu of Taxes, or as-of-right agreement,</b> for example, does not automatically include or exclude the transaction from the requirements of Statement 77.</div></body></html>
