However, if restatement is not feasible, at a minimum the government should clearly note that the information before and after the change is not comparable and should explain the nature of the difference.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Because governments are required to report changes in fund balance information for total governmental funds, the revision of the fund structure would not affect the information unless reallocations were made between the governmental funds and either the proprietary or fiduciary funds. Reallocations within the governmental funds would not impact the total amounts.</div></body></html>
