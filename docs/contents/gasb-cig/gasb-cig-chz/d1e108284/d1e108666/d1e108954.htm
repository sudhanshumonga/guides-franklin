Although applicable to all nonexchange transactions, for practical reasons it generally applies to those transactions that, in practice, are individually recorded (for example, separate donations) rather than those that are recorded in the aggregate (for example, sales taxes).</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Conversely, the requirement in paragraphs 16, 18, and 21 applies to nonexchange transactions that have met the probable-of-collection criterion (for example, separate grants that historical evidence indicates are partially uncollectible in the aggregate even though the particular grants that are partially uncollectible may not be identifiable). It requires <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">revenue </b>for each class of nonexchange transactions to be recognized net of estimated uncollectible amounts and results in an increase to an allowance account (for example, allowance for doubtful accounts) rather than a reduction of the receivable. </div></body></html>
