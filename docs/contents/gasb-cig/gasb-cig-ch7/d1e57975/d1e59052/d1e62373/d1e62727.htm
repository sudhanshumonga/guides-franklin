This answer differs from the response to Question 7.22.11 because the debt is an obligation of the primary government (a separate legal entity), and within its legal entity, the government may <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">assign</b> the debt to the fund from which repayment is expected. On the other hand, a component unit is an entity legally separate from the primary government and a similar &quot;assignment&quot; of debt cannot be made.
