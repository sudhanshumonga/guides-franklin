Required annual contributions to the fund are actuarially determined. Participants pay a pro rata share of the required annual contributions based on total payroll costs for the prior year. The county participates in this fund for its own workers&#39; compensation costs. It has 60 percent of the covered payroll; the local governments have 25 percent of the covered payroll, and not-for-profit organizations have 15 percent of the covered payroll.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> This activity should be accounted for as the county&#39;s own risk management activity (in an internal service fund or in the county&#39;s general fund) because it is the predominant participant. If at any time the county is no longer the predominant participant, then it should report the activity as a risk-sharing public entity risk pool.</div></body></html>
