This alternative display method presents the functional categories (programs) in columns rather than rows, with the total column on the left rather than the right side of the statement. This display technique also allows all of the descriptions to follow consecutively in a single column. The advantages of using this approach quickly erode, however, as the number of columns increases.</div></body></html>
