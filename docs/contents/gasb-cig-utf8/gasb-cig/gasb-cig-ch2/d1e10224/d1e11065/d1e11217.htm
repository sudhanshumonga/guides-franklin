If, however, the proceeds are received by the governmental enterprise (deposited in a cash or cash equivalent of the governmental enterprise) for distribution to another organization, cash flows do occur. The governmental enterprise is operating as an intermediary. Because the cash inflow and the cash outflow do not meet the criteria of the capital and related financing, noncapital financing, or investing activities category, both should be presented in the operating activities category. The operating activities category is the residual category.</div></body></html>
