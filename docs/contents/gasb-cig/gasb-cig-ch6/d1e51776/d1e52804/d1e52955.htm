After such an investment is measured at fair value, the market takes into account accreted discounts. Accordingly, accretion or amortization of discounts is not necessary; amortization has already been considered in the net increase (decrease) in the fair value of investments. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Statement 31, as amended, allows many non-interest-bearing investments to be reported at amortized cost. Amortized cost issues are discussed in Questions <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_amortized_cost_rec1">6.14.1–6.14.3</span>.</div></body></html>
