That is, an employer’s expense is to be based on the annual required contribution of the employer (the ARC), and a net OPEB asset or liability is to be recognized in accrual-basis financial statements for the cumulative difference between recognized expense and contributions made to the plan. However, accumulating assets in a qualifying OPEB plan trust could have the following accounting effects for a sole or agent employer:</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">a.The discount rate used in determining the present value of projected benefits could be affected, and, as a result, the measurement of total actuarial accrued liabilities could be affected if the estimated long-term investment yield on plan assets differs from the estimated long-term investment yield on employer assets. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch8_economic_assumptions__discount_rate_">Section 8.26</span> for questions regarding selection of a discount rate.)</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">b.The measurements of the unfunded actuarial accrued liability and of the ARC could be affected (reduced) because, if the employer accumulates assets in the trust, those assets are to be considered plan assets and subtracted from total actuarial accrued liabilities to determine the net unfunded actuarial accrued liability. These effects potentially would be reflected in amounts recognized in basic financial statements, disclosed in notes, or presented as RSI related to expense, net OPEB obligation, employer contributions as a percentage of annual OPEB cost, and the funded status and funding progress of the plan.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">c.The measurement of the net OPEB obligation could be affected (reduced), because ARC-related payments to the trust, including amounts paid in excess of pay-as-you-go requirements for premiums or claims costs, are to be considered contributions in relation to the ARC for purposes of calculating the net OPEB obligation. (See paragraph 13g of Statement 45.) In contrast, in the absence of a qualifying OPEB plan trust, only premium payments or payments for claims costs are to be counted as contributions in relation to the ARC.</div></body></html>
