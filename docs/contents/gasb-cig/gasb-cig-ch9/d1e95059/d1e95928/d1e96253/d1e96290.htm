Relevant information needed for the revenue capacity schedules is not finalized until after the government&#39;s comprehensive annual financial report is issued. What years should the schedules include?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—With the possible exception of revenue capacity schedules for a property tax, statistical section schedules should cover the 10-year period ending with the current fiscal year reported in the basic financial statements. As described in Question 9.14.1, even when there are differences between tax years and fiscal years, a government should report the tax years that are related to the fiscal years presented in the other schedules.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If reasonable estimates of the pertinent information for the most recent year can be made in time to be included in the schedule, a government should do so, while properly noting that the information is not yet finalized and also describing, if appropriate, the sources of the information and methodologies for deriving it. The estimated information would be updated in subsequent years&#39; schedules. If estimates cannot be made, the information should be reported as &quot;not available&quot; and a note provided to explain why it is absent.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The information about principal payers should be presented for the most recent year that final or reasonably estimable amounts are available. The comparison year may be the first year of the 10-year trend covered in the other schedules, or the period nine years prior (even though the resulting 10-year trend would cover a different period). (For an example, see <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_C-6">Exhibit C-6</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B9-2.) The government could include a footnote that describes this difference.</div></body></html>
