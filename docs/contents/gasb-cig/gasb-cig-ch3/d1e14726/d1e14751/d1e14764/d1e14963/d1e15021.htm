Only the provisions of Statement 10, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#fund_type_to_use_rec1">paragraphs 18 and 51</span>, apply to this type of pool, which will have service revenue and administrative costs for procuring and maintaining policies for participants. The amounts collected from members and remitted to the insurance carriers would be recorded as additions to and deductions from a liability account, rather than as revenue and expense of the risk pool.</div></body></html>
