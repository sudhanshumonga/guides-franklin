Are the charges direct expenses of the agencies? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The Department of Administration&#39;s telephone expense would be reduced by the internal charges (a reimbursement). The department is not a telephone company and the agencies are not its telephone customers; thus, reporting the amount as program revenue would be inappropriate. To the extent that charges can reasonably be identified to specific functions (by actual usage information, for example), they should be included in the direct expense of the functions.</div></body></html>
