However, the pension plan provides to retirees not only pensions but also postemployment healthcare benefits (classified by the GASB as OPEB) under the provisions of IRC Section 401h. Do Statement 68, as amended, (pensions) and Statement 45, as amended, (OPEB) require accounting for the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">pensions</b> and <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">postemployment healthcare benefits</b> separately and require allocation of plan assets and the employer&#39;s contribution to the plan between pension and OPEB contributions? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. The employer (in cooperation with the plan administrator, if applicable) should account separately for its expenses and liabilities for pensions (in conformity with Statement 68, as amended) and for postemployment healthcare benefits (in conformity with Statement 45, as amended). This would require, in part, allocation between pensions and OPEB of both the employer&#39;s total contribution and the total plan fiduciary net position and separate actuarial valuations and calculations related to the two plans. The Statements do not specify the manner in which the allocations necessary to accomplish separate accounting should be made, because that will depend on the specific circumstances, including the benefit structure and terms and the method(s) of financing the pension and postemployment healthcare benefits. </div></body></html>
