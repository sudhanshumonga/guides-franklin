Therefore, for a pension liability reported under Statement 68, as amended, there would be no amount that is “due” within one year unless the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is less than the amount of benefit payments expected to be paid within one year. For a pension liability reported under Statement 73, there is no pension plan fiduciary net position; therefore, the amount “due” within one year would be the full amount of benefit payments expected to be paid within one year.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the employer reports a net OPEB obligation under Statement 45, as amended, the nature of the liability is such that there is no amount that is “due” within one year, and therefore, the amount should be reported as a long-term liability. The net OPEB obligation affects the actuarial calculation of future annual required contributions and thus does not represent a liability that is subject to a payment schedule with current and noncurrent installments.</div></body></html>
