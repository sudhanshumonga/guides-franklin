Are the larger governmental entities required to include underlying jurisdictions located entirely within their borders? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—According to <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs44_par._18">paragraph 18</span> of Statement 44, &quot;overlapping governments are those whose geographic area coincides at least in part with the geographic area of the reporting government.&quot; By this definition, a government would report not only those governments with which it overlaps partially, but also those governments within which it is entirely encompassed, those that are located entirely within its borders, and those with identical geographic boundaries.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">There are, however, two exceptions to this provision. State governments and regional governments are not required to report the rates of overlapping governments, although regional governments are encouraged to do so. Governments below the state level are not required to include rates set by a state government as overlapping rates. (For example, note that the illustrative local government in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_A-13">Exhibit A-13</span> in nonauthoritative Appendix B9-2 includes the sales tax rates of the county within which it resides, but not the rates imposed by its state. Likewise, the illustrative state government in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch9_ex_C-5">Exhibit C-5</span> of nonauthoritative Appendix B9-2 does not present a schedule with the sales tax rates imposed by regional, county, or local governments; it presents only its own direct rate.)</div></body></html>
