The objective of the commodity futures contracts is to hedge market risk. That is, the risk that changes in market prices (overall cash flows) will adversely affect the cash flows of the expected purchase of No. 2 heating oil. The potential hedging derivative instruments are the commodity futures contracts. These derivative instruments would not qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales scope exception because the government is not taking physical delivery of the commodity through the futures contracts. The hedgeable item is the purchase of No. 2 heating oil in December 20X0, an expected transaction. The pricing point used in the expected fuel purchase is different from the pricing point used in the futures contracts, creating basis risk. Therefore, the school district evaluates effectiveness using the synthetic instrument method and determines that the futures contracts are hedging derivative instruments. Accordingly, payments received from the futures contracts are reported as a deferred inflow of resources in the statement of net position as of June 30, 20X0.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">This illustration provides the journal entries and the financial statement presentations related to these commodity futures contracts and the expected purchase of No. 2 heating oil over the life of the futures contracts. </div></body></html>
