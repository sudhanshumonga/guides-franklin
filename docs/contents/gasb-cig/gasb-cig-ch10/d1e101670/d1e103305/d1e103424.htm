The notional amount of the interest rate swap has a predetermined schedule that is the agency’s best estimate of the prepayment speeds of the hedged bonds. As time elapses, however, actual prepayments vary. How should hedge effectiveness be evaluated?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—If the notional amount of the interest rate swap is less than the principal amount of the hedged debt, the agency is under hedged. That circumstance, of and by itself, should not affect the evaluation of hedge effectiveness. On the other hand, if the notional amount of the interest rate swap is more than the principal amount of the hedged debt, the agency is over hedged. In that circumstance, the agency may bifurcate the notional amount so that the hedging notional amount is consistent with the principal amount of the hedged debt. The remainder of the interest rate swap would become an investment derivative instrument and should not be included in the original hedging relationship in subsequent periods. The amount in the deferred inflow of resources or deferred outflow of resources account should be adjusted accordingly.</div></body></html>
