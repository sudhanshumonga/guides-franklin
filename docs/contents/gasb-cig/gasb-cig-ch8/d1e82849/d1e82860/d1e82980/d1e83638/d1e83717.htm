Instead, benefit levels are defined by the plan trustees and may be adjusted periodically by the trustees, subject to the limitation (which has been communicated to the plan members) that benefits will be provided only to the extent that plan assets are available to pay them. The trust is administered as a single pool; individual member accounts are not maintained. Should the employer account for the arrangement as a defined contribution plan?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs45_par._30">Paragraph 30</span> of Statement 45 provides that if a benefit arrangement does not have the characteristics of a defined contribution plan, an employer should apply the requirements of that Statement for defined benefit plans. A defined contribution plan is discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs45_par._5">paragraph 5</span> of Statement 45 as an arrangement that provides an individual account for each plan member and specifies how contributions to an active plan member&#39;s account are to be determined. Further, in a defined contribution plan, the benefits received by a member depend only on the amounts contributed to the member&#39;s account, earnings on investments of those contributions, and forfeitures of contributions made for other members that may be allocated to the member&#39;s account. In the circumstance described in this question, the plan terms do not meet the characteristics of a defined contribution plan because individual accounts are not maintained, the plan terms do not specify how contributions to individual active employees&#39; accounts are to be determined, and benefits do not depend only on the amounts contributed or credited to individual accounts but, rather, on periodic benefit determinations by the plan trustees. Therefore, the arrangement should be accounted for as a defined benefit plan.</div></body></html>
