However, the transactions between the primary government and the potential component unit do not meet the financial benefit/burden criteria. Would this be equivalent to the primary government&#39;s being able to impose its will on the potential component unit? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Dependence on the primary government&#39;s continued purchase of services does not necessarily indicate that a primary government has the ability to impose its will. This situation may indicate that the potential component unit may be reliant on the primary government to purchase its services, but may not result in the primary government&#39;s having the ability to impose its will, as defined by paragraph 26 of Statement 14. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_imposition_of_will_2_rec1">Question 4.20.1</span>.) Essentially, this would be the same as the primary government&#39;s being the main resource provider for an organization. (See <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_4_question_20">Question 4.9.4</span> for additional discussion of reliance on financing.)</div></body></html>
