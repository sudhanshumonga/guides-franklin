If not, how should the employer account for such sick leave to healthcare account conversions? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—None of the activities mentioned constitutes OPEB. Conversion of unused sick leave to an individual defined contribution healthcare account is an example of a &quot;termination payment&quot; of sick leave, as discussed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs16_footnote_6">footnote 6</span> of Statement 16, as amended. To the extent that sick leave is expected to be settled by a cash payment to a terminating employee or by the establishment of an individual healthcare account to be applied on the individual&#39;s behalf after termination of employment, the employer&#39;s expense and a liability should be accrued in accordance with the requirements of Statement 16 by an employee&#39;s termination date. If the employer remits cash in the amount of an individual&#39;s account balance to a third-party administrator, the employer should account for the disbursement by reducing cash and compensated absence liabilities; there is no new expense to be recognized. If, instead, the employer administers the account, the employer might, at most, reclassify the liability from general compensated absence liabilities to a specific account in the terminated employee&#39;s name. Subsequent disbursements from an individual&#39;s account for the individual&#39;s share of healthcare premiums or benefits should be accounted for by reducing cash and the individual&#39;s account (liability). The payments should be regarded as member contributions, not employer contributions.</div></body></html>
