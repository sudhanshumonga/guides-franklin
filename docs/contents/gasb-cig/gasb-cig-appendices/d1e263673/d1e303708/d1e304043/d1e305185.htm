Article 30 of the Statutes of the State assigns the authority to establish and amend the benefit terms to ERA’s Board of Trustees (ERA Board). Retirement, disability, and death benefits are provided through ERA for qualified employees of the County. ERA issues a publicly available financial report that can be obtained at [Internet address].</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Retirement benefits are determined as 2.5 percent of the employee’s final 3-year average compensation times the employee’s years of service. Employees with 10 years of continuous service are eligible to retire at age 60. Employees are eligible for service-related disability benefits regardless of length of service. Five years of service is required for nonservice-related disability eligibility. Disability benefits are determined in the same manner as retirement benefits but are payable immediately without an actuarial reduction. Death benefits equal the employee’s final full-year salary.</div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Contributions</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Contributions.</b> Per Article 30 of the State Statutes, contribution requirements of the active employees and the participating governments are established and may be amended by the ERA Board. Employees are required to contribute 4.0 percent of their annual pay. The County’s contractually required contribution rate for the year ended June 30, 20X2, was 4.08 percent of annual payroll, actuarially determined as an amount that, when combined with employee contributions, is expected to finance the costs of benefits earned by employees during the year, with an additional amount to finance any unfunded accrued liability. Contributions to the pension plan from the County were $5,202,000 for the year ended June 30, 20X2.</div><div class="ps_fourth_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_fourth_heading">Pension Liabilities, Pension Expense, and Deferred Outflows of Resources and Deferred Inflows of Resources Related to Pensions</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">At June 30, 20X2, the County reported a liability of $164,979,150 for its proportionate share of the net pension liability. The net pension liability was measured as of December 31, 20X1, and the total pension liability used to calculate the net pension liability was determined by an actuarial valuation as of that date. The County’s proportion of the net pension liability was based on a projection of the County’s long-term share of contributions to the pension plan relative to the projected contributions of all participating employers, actuarially determined. At December 31, 20X1, the County’s proportion was 2.21 percent, which was an increase of 0.11 from its proportion measured as of December 31, 20X0.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">For the year ended June 30, 20X2, the County recognized pension expense of $26,490,000.

As a result of the 20X1 actuarial experience study, the expectation of life after disability was adjusted in the December 31, 20X1 actuarial valuation to more closely reflect actual experience.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was determined using a building-block method in which best-estimate ranges of expected future real rates of return (expected returns, net of pension plan investment expense and inflation) are developed for each major asset class. These ranges are combined to produce the long-term expected rate of return by weighting the expected future real rates of return by the target asset allocation percentage and by adding expected inflation. The target allocation and best estimates of arithmetic real rates of return for each major asset class are summarized in the following table:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Discount rate.</b> The discount rate used to measure the total pension liability was 7.75 percent. The projection of cash flows used to determine the discount rate assumed that employee contributions will be made at the current contribution rate and that contributions from employers will be made at contractually required rates, actuarially determined. Based on those assumptions, the pension plan’s fiduciary net position was projected to be available to make all projected future benefit payments of current active and inactive employees. Therefore, the long-term expected rate of return on pension plan investments was applied to all periods of projected benefit payments to determine the total pension liability.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Sensitivity of the County’s proportionate share of the net pension liability to changes in the discount rate.</b> The following presents the County’s proportionate share of the net pension liability calculated using the discount rate of 7.75 percent, as well as what the County’s proportionate share of the net pension liability would be if it were calculated using a discount rate that is 1-percentage-point lower (6.75 percent) or 1-percentage-point higher (8.75 percent) than the current rate:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Pension plan fiduciary net position.</b> Detailed information about the pension plan’s fiduciary net position is available in the separately issued ERA financial report. </div></body></html>
