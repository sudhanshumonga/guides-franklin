Governments do not apply a particular rate (or rates) to an existing base. Nevertheless, a government can apply its professional judgment to develop schedules that would provide analogous information based on the objectives set forth in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs44_par._6">paragraph 6b</span> of Statement 44. For instance, revenue base information could take the form of a schedule of fair values by type of investment for the past 10 fiscal years. Revenue rate information could be rates of return by type of investment for the past 10 years. For principal payer information, a government could present investment income by type of investment for the current year and nine years ago.</div></body></html>
