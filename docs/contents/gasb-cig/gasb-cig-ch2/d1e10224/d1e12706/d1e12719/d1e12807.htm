(See Question 2.29.1.) One of the major classes is &quot;cash payments to employees for services.&quot; Statement 9 does not provide a definition for this or any other of the major classes referred to in paragraph 31, as amended. It is reasonable to group cash payments for payroll taxes and fringe benefits with cash payments to employees, even though the cash is not paid directly to the employees. Payroll taxes and fringe benefits are paid on behalf of employees and are an integral part of employment costs.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">On the other hand, further detail is encouraged if it would be useful.
