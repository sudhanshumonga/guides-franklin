However, if the component unit&#39;s fiscal year ends within the first quarter of the reporting entity&#39;s subsequent fiscal year, the reporting entity can incorporate that fiscal year of the component unit, rather than the fiscal year ending during the reporting entity&#39;s fiscal period. For example, a primary government that has a fiscal year ending December 31, 20X4, can include the data of component units that have fiscal years ending from January 1, 20X4, through March 31, 20X5.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs14_par._60">Paragraph 60</span> of Statement 14, as amended, states that if transactions with component units that have different fiscal years result in inconsistencies in amounts reported as receivable or payable, or disclosed in the notes (as required by <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._128">paragraph 128</span> of Statement 34), the nature and amount of those transactions should be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.
