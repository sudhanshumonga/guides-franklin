The municipality issues bonds that will be repaid from the incremental taxes generated by the enhanced property values of the redeveloped area. Several other local taxing bodies, whose tax rates are also levied against the property in the district, agree to forgo their shares of the incremental taxes until the bonds are retired. Are those other local taxing bodies required to make the pledged revenue disclosures in paragraph 21 of Statement 48? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>No. In the situation described, only the municipality that issues the debt is required to make those disclosures. The incremental taxes of the other taxing bodies are not considered to be <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">pledged</b> revenues. Paragraph 21 requires disclosure about “specific revenues that have been formally committed to directly collateralize or secure debt of the pledging government, or directly or indirectly collateralize or secure debt of a component unit.” Because those taxing bodies did not issue the debt and because the municipality is not a component unit of any of those taxing bodies, the disclosures in paragraph 21 are not required to be made by those taxing bodies.</div></body></html>
