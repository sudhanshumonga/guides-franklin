That is, member contributions were subtracted from age-adjusted premiums to determine the employer’s contributions for active-employee and retiree benefits, rather than taking employer contribution rates based on blended premium rates as given and backing into member contributions. Also, it should be noted that the age-adjusted premiums, retiree contributions, and employer contributions for retiree healthcare benefits are the same with or without the cap on the employer’s share of contributions for active-employee healthcare benefits. The effect of the cap, rather, is to substantially lower the employer’s contributions and expense for active-employee healthcare benefits.</div></body></html>
