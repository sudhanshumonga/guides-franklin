Statement 72 applies to all deposits and investments that should be reported at fair value. In addition, paragraph 69 of Statement 72, as amended, provides for measurement of certain investments at other than fair value. Therefore, the Statements apply to deposit and investment transactions of all funds, including those for which the reporting entity is a custodian and that are reported in an agency, trust, or other fund—such as deferred compensation plan assets and pooled amounts invested by a state treasurer on behalf of local governments. (See also Statement No. 32, <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Accounting and Financial Reporting for Internal Revenue Code Section 457 Deferred Compensation Plans</b>, as amended, and Question 1.52.1 concerning Internal Revenue Code [IRC] Section 457 deferred compensation plan assets.)</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Many of the deposits and investments that are subject to the disclosure requirements of Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and Statement 72 may be reported in the statement of net position/balance sheet using different titles. For example, some deposits and investments may be reported in the statement of net position/balance sheet as “cash and cash equivalents.” (See Question 1.26.6.) Others may be reported in the statement of net position/balance sheet using titles that do not identify their nature as deposits and investments. For example, securities held as escheats or other unclaimed property may be reported in an agency fund or private-purpose trust fund without specific identification of the nature of the item. Despite the statement of fiduciary net position presentation, those securities are subject to the disclosure requirements of Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and Statement 72 for investments.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Sometimes questions arise as to whether annuity contracts that are in the name of lottery prize winners are subject to the disclosure requirements of Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and Statement 72. If they are reported in the government’s financial statements, they are subject to those requirements. Further, Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and Statement 72 apply to deposits and investments held by another entity for a government—for example, amounts held by fiscal agents for bond payments and reserves—if they are reported on the face of the government’s financial statements.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and Statement 72 also apply to deposits and investments of component units included in a reporting entity’s financial statements, although the manner in which they are applied should consider the requirements of Statement 14, as amended. Specifically, Statement 14 requires that disclosures for discretely presented component units be made separately from disclosures for the primary government and its blended component units. Applying the requirements of Statement 14 also may result in not presenting disclosures required by Statements 3 and 40, as amended, and Statement 72 for some discretely presented component units. (See Question 1.4.5 about disclosures for discretely presented component units.)
