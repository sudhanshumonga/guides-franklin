Workers also may be required to use special disposable clothing and respirators. Are outlays for these items potentially capitalizable as pollution <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">prevention or control</b> outlays, which are outside the scope of Statement 49? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Because the outlays address the current or potential detrimental effects of existing pollution by participating in pollution remediation activities (such as containment or removal and disposal of pollutants), the outlays are pollution <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">remediation</b> outlays, as defined by Statement 49. Accordingly, the outlays would be evaluated for recognition as a liability once an obligating event occurs (typically, when the government commences cleanup activities). </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Paragraph 22 notes that some maintenance projects, “for which the primary objective is other than pollution remediation, may include pollution remediation activities.” For such maintenance projects, it requires that, “incremental outlays attributable to pollution remediation activities (outlays that would not be incurred absent pollution) should be reported as an expense when a pollution remediation liability is recognized,” unless one of the specific capitalization criteria is met. However, the nonincremental outlays are not subject to the capitalization criteria and limits of Statement 49.</div></body></html>
