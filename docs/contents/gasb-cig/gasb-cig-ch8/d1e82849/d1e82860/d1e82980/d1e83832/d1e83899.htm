Unused sick leave is converted to postemployment healthcare benefits at the rate of one month of healthcare premiums, up to a stipulated maximum monthly amount, for each eight hours of unused leave. The employer does not otherwise provide postemployment healthcare benefits and does not otherwise compensate employees for unused sick leave.
