However, what is considered significant in one relationship might be insignificant in another. For example, a component unit that has significant cash balances or other resources might not be considered “major” if it is included because of imposition of will, while another component unit with significant cash balances or other resources might be considered “major” if it is included because the primary government has the ability to access its resources.</div></body></html>
