A government enters into transactions in both markets and can access the price in those markets for the asset at the measurement date. In Market A, the price that would be received at the measurement date is $26, transaction costs in that market are $3, and the costs to transport the asset to that market are $2 (therefore, the net amount that would be received from selling that asset in Market A is $21). In Market B, the price that would be received at the measurement date is $25, transaction costs in that market are $1, and the costs to transport the asset to that market are $2 (therefore, the net amount that would be received from selling that asset in Market B is $22). How can the government distinguish between the principal market and the most advantageous market for purposes of determining fair value?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">A—If Market A is the principal market for the asset (that is, the market with the greatest volume and level of activity for the asset), the fair value of the asset would be measured using the price that would be received in that market, after taking into account transportation costs ($24).</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If neither market is the principal market for the asset, the fair value of the asset would be measured using the price in the most advantageous market. The most advantageous market is the market that maximizes the amount that would be received to sell the asset after taking into account transaction costs and transportation costs (that is, the net amount that would be received in the respective markets).</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Because the government would maximize the net amount that would be received for selling the asset in Market B ($22), the fair value of the asset would be measured using the price in that market ($25), less transportation costs ($2), resulting in a fair value measurement of $23. Although transaction costs are taken into account when determining which market is the most advantageous market, the price used to measure the fair value of the asset is not adjusted for those transaction costs.</div></body></html>
