(See Table A-1.) In comparison, last year net position decreased $6.2 million. Looking at the net position and net expenses of governmental and business-type activities separately, however, two very different stories emerge.</div><div class="p ps_graphic_container" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="image cd_online_" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"></span> </div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The net position of the City's governmental activities decreased 2.4 percent to $125.3 million. However, all of the components either are restricted as to the purposes they can be used for or are invested in capital assets (buildings, roads, bridges, and so on). Consequently, the unrestricted component of net position showed a $0.5 million deficit at the end of this year. This deficit does not mean that the City does not have resources available to pay its bills next year. Rather, it is the result of having long-term commitments that are greater than currently available resources. Specifically, the City did not include in past annual budgets the full amounts needed to finance future liabilities arising from property and casualty claims and to pay for unused employee vacation and sick days. The City will include these amounts in future years' budgets as they come due.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">In addition, the deficit in unrestricted governmental net position was adversely affected by two particular features of the City's recent financial activity:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•During the past two years tax revenues and State grants fell short of expectations.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The City Council used accumulated cash balances to avoid tax increases.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Although the net position of our business-type activities increased by 4.4 percent to $87.3 million, these resources cannot be used to make up for the decrease in net position for governmental activities. The City generally can only use these resources to finance the continuing operations of the water, sewer, and parking operations.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Changes in net position. </b>The City's total revenues (excluding special items) increased by 4.5 percent to $115.0 million. (See Table A-2.) Virtually half of the City's revenue comes from property taxes, and 60 cents of every dollar raised comes from some type of tax. (See Figure A-3.) Another quarter comes from fees charged for services, and most of the rest is state and federal aid.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The total cost of all programs and services was virtually unchanged (increasing approximately $900,000, or less than 1 percent). The City's expenses cover a range of services, with about half related to public safety and education. (See Figure A-4.)</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_43" class="image cd_online_ object_link" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"></span> (<b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the "Document" tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img id="gasb-qa_object_44" class="image cd_online_ object_link" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online; object_link" data-attr-placement="inline"></span> (<b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">To close table, click on the "Document" tab at the bottom of your screen.</b>)</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Table A-2 and the narrative that follows consider the operations of governmental and business-type activities separately.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Governmental Activities</b> </div><div class="p keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="keep-w-prev ps_para_1_sm-tab">Revenues for the City's governmental activities (excluding the sale of park land) increased 3.8 percent, while total expenses increased 1 percent. With the gain on the sale of the park land and transfers, the decrease in net position for governmental activities was narrowed to $3.2 million in 20X2. This compares to a $9.3 million decrease in 20X1.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The City's management took three major actions this year to avoid the level of decrease in net position reported last year. Two of these actions increased revenues and a third reduced expenses:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•The City increased property tax rates an average of 5 percent. This increase, the first in four years, raised tax revenues $2.8 million in 20X2. Based on increases in property values, tax revenues are budgeted to increase an additional $2.8 million next year.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The City sold three parcels of park land for $3.5 million, for a gain (net of the $823,000 originally paid) of $2.7 million. This was a one-time special item. Although this property has been added back to the tax rolls, the tax revenues it may generate in the future are not expected to be at the same level as the City received this year by selling the land.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The City imposed a hiring and overtime freeze (excluding the City's police, fire, and sanitation departments) in midyear that resulted in a $2.2 million savings in wages and related benefits expenses in 20X2 compared to 20X1. This freeze, plus cost savings of $500,000 from our continuing staff restructuring efforts, held down the increase in expenses.</div><div class="p ps_graphic_container" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="image cd_online_" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"></span> </div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Despite the rate increase, property tax revenues lagged by $680,000 compared to the final budget estimates because delays in several major commercial and residential developments precluded adding them to this year's tax rolls. More than half of the City's other revenue sources also fell short of final budget estimates. The fire at the State Street Mall affected many retail businesses in the City. In addition, grant revenues were lower than expected because of overall state cutbacks.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Table A-3 presents the cost of each of the City's five largest programs—police, fire, public works, education, and parks and recreation—as well as each program's <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">net cost</b> (total cost less fees generated by the activities and intergovernmental aid). The net cost shows the financial burden that was placed on the City's taxpayers by each of these functions.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•The cost of all <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">governmental</b> activities this year was $106.0 million.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Some of the cost was paid by:</div><div class="p ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–Those who directly benefited from the programs ($15.9 million), or</div><div class="p ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_sub_para_bullet_list_2">–Other governments and organizations that subsidized certain programs with grants and contributions ($10.1 million).</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•The City paid for the $80.0 million "public benefit" portion with $69.4 million in taxes, and with other revenues such as the park land sale, interest, and unrestricted state aid.</div><div class="p ps_graphic_container" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="image cd_online_" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"></span> </div><div class="p ps_secondary_heading" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">Business-Type Activities</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Revenues of the City's business-type activities increased 9.2 percent to $15.5 million, and expenses <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">decreased</b> 1.7 percent to $11.3 million. (Refer to Table A-2.) Factors contributing to these results included:</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_1" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_1">•A 10 percent increase in water and sewer operating revenues (driven by growth in hook-ups of residential customers converting from septic systems); operating expenses rose only 4 percent. The high maintenance costs caused by the harsh winter months of 20X1 did not occur this year.</div><div class="p ps_para_bullet_list_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_bullet_list_2">•Continued program losses at City parking facilities—$1.4 million this year versus $1.3 million in 2011. In both years the deficit was attributable primarily to the largest of the three City-owned garages, located on State Street. This year, the garage had to be closed for two extended periods due to ruptured gas lines beneath nearby streets, which now have been repaired, and the State Street Mall fire.</div></body></html>
