The resolution, also the highest form of decision-making authority, commits the amount as the maximum and acknowledges that unneeded resources at the end of the project will be returned to the general fund or transferred to other construction projects. Should the initial amount set forth in the resolution be classified as committed fund balance? How should the residual balance be classified?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The preconstruction estimated amount should be classified as committed fund balance. The resolution also “un-commits” any unneeded residual balance at the end of the project, so no additional action is required to be taken by the county board of supervisors.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the capital project is completed and the residual resources in the capital projects fund are to be returned to the general fund, the capital projects fund should recognize the amount as due to the general fund. If the construction project is accounted for in the general fund, the residual amount would be reclassified as unassigned. If the residual amount is to be used for another capital project, the initial resolution has already committed that amount and no reclassification or additional board action is needed—the resources remain committed to capital projects.</div></body></html>
