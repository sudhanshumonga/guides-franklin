In some instances an internal service fund operation includes revenues and expenses that are not &quot;internal&quot; or includes elements that are reported separately in the statement of activities. For example, investment income is generally reported separately in the general revenues section of the statement of activities; therefore, if an internal service fund has significant investment income, that amount should be included with investment income, rather than allocated among the various participating functions or programs. Similarly, interest expense is generally reported as a separate expense category in the statement of activities. Therefore, if an internal service fund has significant interest expense, that amount should be allocated to the interest expense line item, rather than the various functions or programs. In addition, grants and contributions from external parties, if included in the calculation for the look-back adjustment, would have the effect of understating the direct expenses of the participating functions or programs. Consequently, those grants and contributions should be reported in the statement of activities as program or general revenues, as appropriate.</div></body></html>
