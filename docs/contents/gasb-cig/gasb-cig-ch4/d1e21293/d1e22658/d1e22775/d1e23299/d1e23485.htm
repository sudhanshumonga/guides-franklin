The potential component unit has been in the same facilities for many years and is expected to stay there indefinitely. Does this approval authority give the primary government the ability to impose its will on the potential component unit? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Paragraph 26 of Statement 14 states that &quot;a primary government has the ability to impose its will on an organization if it can significantly influence the . . . level of services performed or provided by the organization . . .&quot; (italics omitted). If the primary government has the authority to prohibit the organization from moving to another facility and the primary government controls all changes to the facilities, the primary government would have the ability to significantly influence the level of services provided. However, if the organization is free to move to another facility at will, the primary government&#39;s influence is no different from that of a landlord and would not constitute the ability to impose its will on the organization.</div></body></html>
