However, if a portion of existing fund balance is included as a budgetary resource in the subsequent year&#39;s budget to eliminate a projected excess of expected expenditures over expected revenues, then that portion of fund balance (in an amount no greater than is necessary to eliminate the excess) should be classified as assigned. The amount should not be classified as committed because the governing body does not have to take formal action to remove or modify that specific use-the purpose assignment expires with the appropriation. </div></body></html>
