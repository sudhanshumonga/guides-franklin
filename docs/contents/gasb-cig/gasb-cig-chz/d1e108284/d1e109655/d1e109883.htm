Should FEMA grants be accounted for in accordance with the requirements for insurance recoveries in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs42_par._21">paragraph 21</span> of Statement 42? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>No. FEMA grants are nonexchange transactions, should be reported as program revenue in the government-wide financial statements and as revenue in fund financial statements (nonoperating revenue in enterprise and internal service funds), and should not be netted against any associated impairment loss. Insurance recoveries are netted with associated impairment losses because the insurance recovery is received in accordance with an insurance contract in effect prior to the impairment event. With FEMA grants, awards are provided after the impairment event occurs only if a government applies for and meets the applicable grant requirements. The award constitutes a separate transaction from the impairment event.</div></body></html>
