Paragraph 13 defines four types of pools: risk-sharing, insurance-purchasing, banking, and claims-servicing. Further, that paragraph states that &quot;. . . a pool could serve only one or several of these functions&quot; (the four basic types of pools). As an example, members of a property and liability public entity risk pool may pay actuarially determined contributions (premiums). These contributions may be used to pay claims up to an aggregate amount of $10 million and to procure excess insurance for claims that surpass the $10 million threshold. In this instance, the pool is both a risk-sharing pool (for aggregate claims of $10 million or less) and an insurance-purchasing pool (for aggregate claims over $10 million).</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">In any case, if there is any aspect of the pool that qualifies as risk-sharing or risk transfer among pool participants, or if the pool retains any risk, the pool should be accounted for as a risk-sharing pool. For example, if only 5 percent of a pool&#39;s activities (that is, risk covered) involves pooling of risk and the remaining 95 percent involves purchasing commercial policies for participants&#39; risks, the pool should be accounted for as a risk-sharing pool. The requirements of paragraphs 18–50 of Statement 10, as amended, should be applied to the risk-sharing activities, and the requirements of the last two sentences of paragraph 51 should be applied to the insurance-purchasing activities.</div></body></html>
