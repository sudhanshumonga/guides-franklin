It may be confusing to identify a cash flow in a banking environment. Generally, cash flows only if it changes hands; that is, ownership of cash legally changes. In an internal exchange transaction conducted totally within a bank, a cash transaction occurs only if a debit or credit is made to a governmental enterprise&#39;s bank account. For example, a service charge or interest income is considered to be a cash transaction on the date the bank posts the amount to the account. After that date, the interest amount is available for withdrawal or the amount posted for the service charge is no longer available for withdrawal. Another example is a loan granted by a bank. If the loan proceeds are credited to the borrower&#39;s bank account, a cash flow occurred. If the bank remitted the proceeds directly to the vendor, a noncash financing activity occurred.
