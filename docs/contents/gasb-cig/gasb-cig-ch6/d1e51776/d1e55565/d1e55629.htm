As part of the initial implementation of Statement 72, the government should evaluate its capital assets, investments, and other assets to determine if any of those assets should be reclassified based on the definition of an investment in Statement 72. For this purpose, the classification should be based on the facts and circumstances at initial implementation of the requirements of Statement 72, rather than on those in existence at the time the asset was initially acquired. After those classifications have been established as part of the implementation of Statement 72, they should not be changed for financial reporting purposes.</div></body></html>
