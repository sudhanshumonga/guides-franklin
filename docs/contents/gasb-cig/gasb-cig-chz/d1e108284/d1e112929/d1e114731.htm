The statutes also provide that the local government “may abolish its working cash fund by resolution and may transfer any balance remaining in the fund, including any interest that may have accrued, to the general fund.” How should the government report the transactions and resulting fund balances? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The proceeds from the bonds should be included in unassigned fund balance of the general fund. Because the proceeds can only be loaned to other funds and may be used for any purpose, they do not represent restricted resources, and because they are not revenues, they cannot provide the foundation for a special revenue fund. Even though the amounts loaned to other funds are required to be repaid by those funds, the working capital resources (the remaining bond proceeds reported in the general fund) should not be classified as nonspendable because the government has the ability to unilaterally abolish the fund and spend the resources out of the general fund for any purpose. The tax revenues from the dedicated levy are restricted for debt service because the authorizing statute limits the use of the revenues to principal and interest payments on the working capital bonds.
