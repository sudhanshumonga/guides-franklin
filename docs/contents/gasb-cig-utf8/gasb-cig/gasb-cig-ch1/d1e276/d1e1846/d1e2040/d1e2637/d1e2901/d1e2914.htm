How are investment securities in book entry systems owned by or pledged to governments?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Book entry is a system that eliminates the need for physically moving bearer-form paper or re-registering securities certificates to transfer ownership. There are two types of book entry systems. The first is a system operated by or for the issuer of the securities. An example is the system operated by the Federal Reserve for the securities of the U.S. Treasury and various U.S. government agencies. The securities in the Federal Reserve System are referred to as book entry securities; these securities do not exist in paper form, but only as entries on the automated records of the Federal Reserve System. The second type of book entry system is a securities depository system, such as that operated by the Depository Trust Company (DTC). In a depository system, paper securities are held by the depository in bearer form or registered in the depository's nominee name. A depository also may hold securities in the Federal Reserve's book entry system.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">A government's access to the investment securities in these book entry systems generally is through the accounts of members or participants of the system, generally financial institutions and broker-dealers. Governments do not have their own accounts to hold book entry securities except in limited situations involving the Federal Reserve and Treasury systems as described in <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_67" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_1_question_67">Question 1.23.3</span>. (See also <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_special_collateral_arrangements_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_special_collateral_arrangements_rec1">Question 1.36.1</span> on <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Federal Reserve pledge accounts</b>.) Members and participants can use separate accounts for securities belonging to their customers. Different systems refer to these <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">customer accounts</b> differently—for example, using the term <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">custodial</b> or <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fiduciary.</b> Some depository system participants have opened separate accounts for large governmental investors, such as retirement systems.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">For a government's book entry investment securities to meet the "held in the name of the government" criterion, two conditions have to exist. First, the investment securities should be held in the book entry system in an account designated as a customer account. (Alternatively, the investment securities can be in a street name or nominee name account. As discussed in Question 1.22.1, there is the presumption with the use of street and nominee names that another party may be the true beneficial owner.) Second, the member or participant custodian's internal records should identify the government as the owner or pledgee of the securities.</div></body></html>
