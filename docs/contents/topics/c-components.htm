Maintaining the front-end behavior of a single cluster, <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> splits into multiple execution clusters behind the scenes, allowing efficient scheduling and completion of large numbers of jobs.</div><div class="p">Use <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> to combine multiple clusters and streamline administration, or to increase the capacity of already large clusters. A single cluster within a group is designated as the <em class="term display-inline">submission cluster</em>. The submission cluster will manage the distribution of each job to a specific <em class="term display-inline">execution cluster</em> from a pool of available execution clusters.</div><div class="section"><h2 class="title">Submission clusters</h2><div class="p">The submission cluster is the job submission gateway, the scheduling hub, and the user interface of <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em>. Through the submission cluster, jobs are forwarded for rapid scheduling in each execution cluster, <em class="term display-inline">StormCluster</em> policies are implemented, and job queries are submitted.</div><div class="p">The submission cluster silently communicates with multiple execution clusters, sending jobs and receiving updates behind the scenes. The submission cluster will communicate with <em class="term display-inline">ClusterBalance</em> in order to make optimal use of available computing resources.</div></div><div class="section"><h2 class="title">Execution clusters</h2><div class="p">Execution clusters are transparent to users. They are configured by administrators as natural extensions of the submission cluster. Execution cluster configuration mirrors that of the submission cluster, while using the capacity of each execution cluster master host for local job scheduling.</div><div class="p">From the perspective of users or other software components, the execution clusters are invisible and effectively act as mirrored submission clusters.</div></div></body></html>
