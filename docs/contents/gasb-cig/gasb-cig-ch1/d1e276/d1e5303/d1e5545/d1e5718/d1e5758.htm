As noted in Question 1.63.1, Statement 40, as amended, does not address the type of simulation model that a government is required to use to disclose its interest rate risk. OAS is the spread relative to a risk-free interest rate that equates the theoretical present value of a series of uncertain cash flows of an instrument to its current market price. OAS can be viewed as the compensation an investor receives for assuming a variety of risks, less the cost of any embedded options. Evaluating the OAS of an investment requires the determination of the component of a security&#39;s yield that is attributed to embedded options. Governments choosing to utilize an OAS model may find that they can incorporate assumptions regarding the uncertainty of cash flows associated with such variable securities that would otherwise need to be disclosed under the requirements of <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._16">paragraph 16</span> of Statement 40, as amended, for highly sensitive investments. Generally when constructing an OAS model, a government would need to simulate a sufficiently large number of random future interest rate scenarios, or interest rate paths, and then apply a prepayment model to project cash flows along each simulated path. OAS models can be generated with specialized investment software.</div></body></html>
