The primary government used the proceeds to construct new infrastructure assets. The bonds are a liability of the component unit and are secured by, and payable solely from, annual appropriations from the primary government. The primary government has pledged certain of its future federal transportation revenues to provide the resources for the annual appropriations. Should the bonds be regarded as capital-related debt of the component unit? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. The bonds do not represent capital-related debt of the component unit because it did not use the proceeds to acquire, construct, or improve the component unit&#39;s capital assets. The primary government should report the proceeds received as a liability to the component unit because it is obligated to repay the component unit with the pledged future revenues. The primary government should consider the liability to the component unit as capital-related debt, to the extent that the proceeds have been spent on highway construction. Unspent proceeds would be a factor in calculating restricted net position. The bonds payable reported by the component unit should be considered noncapital (and, therefore, enter into the calculation of unrestricted net position) because the proceeds were used to acquire the receivable from the primary government, rather than capital assets.
