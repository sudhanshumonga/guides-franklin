Does it have to present a schedule of property tax levies and collections, even though the sales tax is its largest (and therefore most significant) own-source revenue? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Governments are required to present revenue capacity information for only their largest own-source revenue. Although presenting information for a second revenue is optional, governments are expected to present the full complement of schedules for each revenue, including the levies and collections information for a property tax. By deciding to present information about the second own-source revenue, a government has acknowledged that it is significant and therefore important to the users of its financial report. Users will expect to see a levies and collections schedule when revenue capacity information is presented for a property tax.</div></body></html>
