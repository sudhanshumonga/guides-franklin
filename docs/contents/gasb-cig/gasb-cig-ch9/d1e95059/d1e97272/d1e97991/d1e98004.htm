Statement 44 does not require governments to utilize the coverage formulas stipulated in their bond covenants because the purpose of this schedule is to help the user assess a government&#39;s ability to generate sufficient resources to repay debt, rather than to demonstrate legal compliance. Furthermore, because coverage formulas may vary from issue to issue, requiring the use of covenanted formulas potentially could interfere with a government&#39;s ability to aggregate debt being repaid from the same revenue stream, and may make the schedule so voluminous that its usefulness would be lessened.</div></body></html>
