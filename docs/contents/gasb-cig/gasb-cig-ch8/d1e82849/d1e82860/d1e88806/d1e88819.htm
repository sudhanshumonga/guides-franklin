The method incorporates the same broad measurement steps as an actuarial valuation—projecting future cash outlays for benefits, discounting projected benefits to present value, and allocating the present value of benefits to periods using an actuarial cost method. In addition, the alternative measurement method requires employers to consider all elements of the substantive plan that would be considered in an actuarial valuation and to make assumptions related to all relevant factors based generally on actuarial standards of practice, unless a permissible simplification of an assumption is specifically identified in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs45_par._34">paragraphs 34 and 35</span> of Statement 45.</div></body></html>
