If the bond paying agent pools the assets it receives from various sources and allocates investment earnings to all participants, the assets should be viewed as equity in a pool. According to <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#focus_on_cash_and_cash_equivalents_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-op#focus_on_cash_and_cash_equivalents_rec1">footnote 5</span> of Statement 9 (and explained in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#cash_management_and_investment_pools_rec1" data-attr-href="gasb-op#cash_management_and_investment_pools_rec1">paragraph 50</span> of the Basis for Conclusions), equity in a pool should be treated as either cash or an investment. If the governmental enterprise is able to deposit additional cash at any time and also effectively may withdraw cash at any time without prior notice or penalty, the equity in the pool may be treated as cash. If not, it is an investment.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Because the equity in the pool is restricted, there may be a question about whether the governmental enterprise may withdraw cash at any time. Even though the governmental enterprise may not be able to access its equity in the pool because the assets are legally restricted, it is able to withdraw cash by directing the bond paying agent to pay bondholders or others for whom the assets are restricted. The legal restrictions affect the governmental enterprise's access to the assets and the timing of payment to bondholders, but the restrictions do not change the characteristics of the account in which the assets are held. Statement 9, paragraph 8, disregards restriction of use as a factor in determining whether an asset meets the definition of cash or a cash equivalent.</div></body></html>
