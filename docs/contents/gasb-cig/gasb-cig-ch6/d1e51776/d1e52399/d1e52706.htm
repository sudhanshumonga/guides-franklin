A government’s purpose for acquiring a particular asset is key to identifying it as an investment. For example, a retirement plan may own a building whose present service capacity is based solely on its ability to generate cash. In that circumstance, the building is classified as an investment.

In that circumstance, the building is not considered an investment.</div></body></html>
