The letter of transmittal remains a part of the introductory section. Because the scope of the letter of transmittal introduces the CAFR, and because MD&amp;A derives from the basic financial statements and generally limits its discussion and analysis to information in those statements, a logical progression would be to move from the letter of transmittal, to MD&amp;A, to the basic financial statements. In addition, to place the letter of transmittal between MD&amp;A (which is RSI) and audited basic financial statements might imply a higher level of auditor involvement with the letter of transmittal than is actually the case. </div></body></html>
