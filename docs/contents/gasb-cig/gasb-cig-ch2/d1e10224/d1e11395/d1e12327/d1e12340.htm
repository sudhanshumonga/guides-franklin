Would a finance authority created to finance state building projects meet the provisions of paragraph 19? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Except for low-income housing mortgage programs and student loan programs, few, if any, programs qualify for special treatment under paragraph 19. The presumption should be to classify the making and collecting of all loans as investing activities. Paragraph 19 of Statement 9 provides an <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">exception</b> to the classification scheme set forth in the Statement by allowing the cash flows associated with making and collecting <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">certain</b> program loans to be presented in the operating activities category rather than the investing activities category. Only the cash flows associated with making and collecting the loans are affected. The underlying financing transactions should be classified as noncapital financing activities, and the investment of idle cash should be classified as investing activities.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">In deciding to provide the exception in paragraph 19, the Board concluded that it would be inappropriate, in some circumstances, to classify loan activities as investing activities. The Board evaluated the characteristics of governmental loan programs as it deliberated which programs meet the intent of the paragraph 19 exception. It concluded that certain &quot;loan programs&quot; are the operating activities of a governmental enterprise. The loans are not typical investments because they are not necessarily intended to earn a profit. However, the Board did not intend for <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">all</b> loan programs to be classified as operating activities. The loan programs that qualify for special treatment under paragraph 19 are distinguished from other governmental loan programs because they are undertaken to provide a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">direct</b> benefit to <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">individual</b> constituents.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">There are no specific criteria in paragraph 19 of Statement 9 for determining which loan activities should be classified as operating rather than investing activities, nor is there an explanation of &quot;direct benefits&quot; being provided to &quot;individual constituents.&quot; There are only two examples of qualifying loan programs in paragraph 19—low-income housing and student loan programs. In the low-income housing mortgage program example, loans are made to individuals who might not otherwise qualify for a home mortgage. The program is intended to directly benefit the individuals receiving the loans. Usually, the interest rate on a loan provided by this type of program is below the market rate. A student loan program provides similar direct benefits to individuals— students in need of financing their education.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The Board expected few types of loan programs or finance authorities to meet the spirit of the exception provided in paragraph 19, even if making and collecting loans are the primary operations of the enterprise. A finance authority that facilitates financing by serving as an intermediary or conduit generally would not qualify even if the project to be financed indirectly benefits the government or its constituents. For example, an authority created to finance government building projects (such as state office buildings or public university dormitories) would not qualify because the direct beneficiary is the government rather than individual constituents. In the example of a public university dormitory authority, debt is issued by the authority and the proceeds are loaned to universities for their dormitory construction projects. Although the students who eventually live in the dorms will benefit from the activity, the direct beneficiary of the dormitory authority is the university itself, which is part of the governmental financial reporting entity. Such an arrangement merely facilitates the government&#39;s financing process. The substance of the arrangement is that the government issued bonds to serve its own needs.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">It is unlikely that many finance authorities operate loan programs (other than low-income housing and student loans) that qualify for the exception provided in paragraph 19. An exception might be a loan program for elderly persons who are unable to pay their property taxes.
