Is this provision consistent with the criterion in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs67__par__3">paragraph 3a</span> of Statement 67 regarding the irrevocability of contributions?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. As used in paragraph 3a of Statement 67, irrevocability is understood to mean that an employer no longer has ownership or control of the assets, except for any reversionary right once all benefits have been paid. That is, for purposes of the Statement, the trust should be so constituted that assets may flow from an employer to the plan, but not from the plan to an employer—unless and until all obligations to pay benefits in accordance with the plan terms have been satisfied by payment or by defeasance with no remaining risk regarding the amounts to be paid or the value of plan assets.</div></body></html>
