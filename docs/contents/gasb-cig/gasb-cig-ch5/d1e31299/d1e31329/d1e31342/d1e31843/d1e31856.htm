This includes the classification of postemployment healthcare benefits as OPEB, regardless of the manner in which those benefits are provided. As a result, a trust that is used to administer both pensions and postemployment healthcare benefits is subject to the requirements of both Statement 67, as amended, and Statement No. 74, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> Financial Reporting for Postemployment Benefit Plans Other Than Pension Plans,</b> including the requirement for separate reporting of each pension and OPEB plan. Therefore, in the context of this question, the postemployment healthcare plan should be reported separately from the pension plan.</div></body></html>
