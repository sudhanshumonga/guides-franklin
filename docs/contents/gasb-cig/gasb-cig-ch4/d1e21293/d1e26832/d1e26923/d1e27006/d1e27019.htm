The ability to directly access a joint venture&#39;s resources means that the joint venture can be compelled to remit its resources to the participants. The ability to indirectly access a joint venture&#39;s resources occurs when the joint venture can be influenced to undertake projects of interest to the participants. For example, if an organization could be influenced to undertake a specific construction project at the request of a participating entity, this ability would constitute indirect access. Equity interest is evidenced either by ownership in the joint venture&#39;s stock or by an explicit and measurable right to the joint venture&#39;s net resources. For example, if an agreement specifically spells out the participant&#39;s rights to the organization&#39;s net resources based on the original contributions, this would represent an equity interest.</div></body></html>
