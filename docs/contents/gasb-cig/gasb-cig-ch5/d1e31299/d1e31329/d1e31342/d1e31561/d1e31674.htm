In the circumstance described in this question, the purchase of the annuity is a separate transaction between the plan member and the third party. Because there is no potential for a change in the obligation of the employer related to the amounts that will be provided to the plan member as a result of the annuity purchase option, in this case, the annuitization of the plan member’s account balance does not impact the classification of the pension as defined contribution.</div></body></html>
