The use of an internal service fund may be appropriate when a governmental entity wants to segregate certain risk financing activities from its other activities, either for management and analysis or for financial statement presentation. Use of an internal service fund may also be appropriate when a government intends to recover the cost of its risk financing activities from other units of the government or when a government wants to allocate charges and possibly accumulate future catastrophe reserves. For some governments, however, risk financing activities are seen merely as a function of a government as a whole—not of the individual units of the government. In these cases, the use of a governmental fund may be desirable. Although the advantages of using an internal service fund were recognized, it is noted in paragraph 119 of the Basis for Conclusions that the use of an internal service fund is not required because &quot;. . . consistent with the objective of minimizing the number of funds used by a governmental entity, [Statement 10, as amended] does not mandate use of internal service funds. . . .&quot;</div></body></html>
