A separate actuarial valuation is performed for separate classes of plan members (for example, general government employees versus public safety employees), and employers make contributions for each class at the rate for the class applied to the employer’s active-employee covered payroll for the class. Plan assets legally are available to pay benefits to any plan member. What type of plan(s) is the PERS administering?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The classification of the plan depends on whether there is a legal segregation of assets for purposes of providing benefits to the different classes of plan members. In this situation, although different rates are calculated for different classes of plan members, all plan assets legally are available to pay benefits of any plan member, regardless of their employment class. Therefore, this plan is a cost-sharing multiple-employer plan for purposes of applying Statement 67, as amended.</div></body></html>
