This is consistent with traditional balance sheet reporting of zero cash and a liability for the negative amount. Because the accumulation of cash flows during the period results in a negative cash balance, an adjustment should be made to the cash flow amounts. An increase to zero in cash balance should be incorporated into the statement of cash flows by reporting an inflow in the noncapital financing activities category. This presentation reports the circumstances as if the banking system (or cash management pool) implicitly financed the negative cash situation. In the subsequent period, an assumption should be made that the &quot;loan&quot; was repaid, and a noncapital financing outflow should be reported.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The presentation of implicit financing contradicts the requirement that cash flows not be reported unless they actually occur. The alternatives to this solution, however, are impractical and also have their own inconsistencies and contradictions.
