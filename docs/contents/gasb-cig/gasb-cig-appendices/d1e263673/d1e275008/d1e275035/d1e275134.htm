Required annual contributions to the fund are actuarially determined. Participants pay a pro rata share of the required annual contributions based on total payroll costs for the prior year. The county participates in this fund for its own workers&#39; compensation costs. It has 30 percent of the covered payroll; the local governments have 65 percent of the covered payroll, and not-for-profit organizations have 5 percent of the covered payroll.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> This meets the definition of a risk-sharing public entity risk pool: The participants are primarily local governmental units, the sponsor (the county) is not the predominant participant, there is a cooperative effort, and there is transfer of risk.</div></body></html>
