Capital grants should be considered capital and related financing activities, and all other grants should be considered noncapital financing activities. However, it was recognized that certain arrangements that are called &quot;grants&quot; appear to be contracts for services. Grants of this type should be classified as operating activities. The determination of whether a grant is, in substance, a purchase of services requires the exercise of judgment. To be classified as an operating cash inflow, the grant should finance a program that the grantee would not otherwise undertake (for example, a senior citizens&#39; transportation service). Therefore, the grant is not subsidizing an existing program. It reimburses the costs of a new program, whose activity is inherently part of the operations of the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">grantor.</b> A grant with these characteristics should be considered an &quot;operating grant&quot; as described in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs9_par._17">paragraph 17</span> of Statement 9.
