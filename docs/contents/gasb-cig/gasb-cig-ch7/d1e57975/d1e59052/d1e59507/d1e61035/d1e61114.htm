Can parks be considered infrastructure networks and, therefore, be eligible for the modified approach? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Because parks consist primarily of land, which is not considered to be infrastructure, parks should not be considered infrastructure networks. Some of the subsystems within a park, such as roads, trails, or sewers, could be considered infrastructure and could be eligible to use the modified approach. Some of the other components of a park, such as buildings and sports facilities, are depreciable capital assets.</div></body></html>
