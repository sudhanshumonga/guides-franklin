The plan directs one of its outside investment managers to enter into an investment strategy that involves taking positions in foreign currency exchange rates. Those positions include entering into foreign currency derivative instruments. Another outside manager is directed to enter into an investment strategy that includes purchasing and selling foreign currency denominated debt. At the end of the reporting period, the plan determines that the former investment manager entered into a foreign currency swap that takes a position in the U.S. dollar and the British pound exchange rate. The plan also determines that the latter investment manager expects to purchase a British pound denominated bond. When the effects of the foreign currency swap and the expected bond purchase are combined, the swap serves to protect the plan from adverse changes in the dollar/pound exchange rate until the bond was purchased. Is the foreign currency swap a potential hedging derivative instrument that should be evaluated as to whether the swap is an effective hedge of the pension plan’s foreign currency risk arising from the expected bond purchase?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—A potential hedging derivative instrument is a derivative instrument that is <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">associated</b> with a hedgeable item (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.27">paragraph 27a</span> of Statement 53). A hedgeable item cannot be measured at fair value; therefore, the only hedgeable item that could apply in this case would be the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">expected</b> purchases of foreign currency denominated bonds (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.29">paragraph 29</span>). Unless a derivative instrument is associated with a hedgeable item, there is no requirement to evaluate effectiveness (paragraph 27a). Association is determined by consideration of the facts and circumstances. Consideration could include the pension plan’s investment strategy that indicates that derivative instruments are entered in order to take positions in foreign currency exchange rates and the degree of coordination between the plan’s investment managers. Investment managers that pursue independent investment strategies suggest a lack of association. On the other hand, an investment strategy intended to limit foreign currency risk in anticipation of the purchase of a foreign currency denominated investment may indicate association.</div></body></html>
