Equity securities are a significantly different form of investment from U.S. government securities. If the investment activity of the pension trust fund is significant in comparison to the investment activity of the combined entity, Statement 3 requires a statement that the pension fund is additionally authorized to invest in corporate equity securities. A separate list of all of the pension fund&#39;s authorized investment types is not needed.</div></body></html>
