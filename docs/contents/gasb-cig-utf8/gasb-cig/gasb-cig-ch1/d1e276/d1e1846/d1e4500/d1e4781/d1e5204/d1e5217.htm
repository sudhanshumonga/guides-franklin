Custodial credit risk disclosures are required for investments made in foreign markets. Governments need to determine whether these investments are securities and, if so, identify whether they are subject to the custodial credit risk requirements of <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._9" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._9">paragraph 9</span> of Statement 40. Specifically, governments should determine the mechanics of the clearing process, whether the securities are held in paper or book entry form, and the function of any intermediaries in the process. Some foreign markets use a depository system and others do not. The length of the settlement process varies greatly from market to market, with transactions in some markets taking months to settle. A government's custodian often uses correspondents to hold securities in the country where they were purchased. Governments with foreign investment portfolios should work with the portfolio managers or custodians to meet custodial credit risk reporting requirements for their portfolio.</div></body></html>
