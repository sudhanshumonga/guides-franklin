If separate financial reports of the individual pension and postemployment healthcare plans prepared in conformity with GAAP have been issued, the notes to the financial statements should include information about how to obtain those reports. In that case, separate plan financial statements (including notes) for those plans are not required to be presented in the employer’s or sponsor’s report. (However, additional information can be presented in the employer’s or sponsor’s note disclosures if the information is determined to be essential to the fair presentation of the employer’s or sponsor’s basic financial statements.) If separate GAAP-basis plan reports have not been issued, separate financial statements (including notes) for individual pension and postemployment healthcare plans should be presented in the notes to the financial statements and should be accompanied by required schedules of each plan, as applicable. (See paragraph 106 of Statement 34, as amended.)</div></body></html>
