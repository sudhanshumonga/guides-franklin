Professional judgment should be exercised in determining whether an interfund loan should be reclassified. The <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">expectation</b> aspect of the phrase means that the government intends to, and has the ability to, repay the amount loaned. For example, recurring payments made to reduce the interfund loan balance may provide evidence that &quot;repayment is expected.&quot; What constitutes a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">reasonable time</b> for repayment is again a matter of professional judgment, but the notion is not without precedent in financial reporting standards.
