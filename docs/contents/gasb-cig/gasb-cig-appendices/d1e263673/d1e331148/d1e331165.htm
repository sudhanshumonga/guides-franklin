In this case, the plan of involuntary termination meets the criteria of paragraph 14 of Statement 47. That is, it identifies the number, functions, and location of the employees to be terminated, as well as when the terminations will occur. In addition, the plan is sufficiently detailed to enable employees to determine the type and amount of benefits they will receive if they are involuntarily terminated. Therefore, in accordance with paragraph 13 of Statement 47, the town should recognize a liability and expense related to the involuntary termination benefit when the plan is communicated to employees (June 15, 20X1). </div></body></html>
