A portion of the adjustment pertains to the enterprise fund operations. The answer to <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_229">Question 7.47.7</span> states that the &quot;crossover&quot; amount should be reported as an internal balance in the government-wide statement of net position. Could the city instead report the crossover amount as a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">transfer</b> in the statement of activities because the adjustment will not be made in the fund financial statements and will not be &quot;repaid?&quot; </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. To conclude that the amount representing an over- or under-charge by an internal service fund is a permanent transfer is contradictory to the principle that internal service funds should be operated on a break-even basis, with excesses or deficiencies eliminated within a reasonable time through adjustments to future internal charges. As the internal charges are adjusted over time, and as over- and under-charges fluctuate from year to year, the internal balance reported in the statement of net position will rise and fall but should not grow to a significant amount.</div></body></html>
