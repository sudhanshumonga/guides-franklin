Whether or not a debt investment&#39;s credit quality rating downgrade is significant to the reporting entity&#39;s financial statements calls for the exercise of professional judgment. Restrictions on the types of investments allowed by legal or statutory provisions and by the government&#39;s investment policy may prevent a government from having a large credit risk exposure in a single entity&#39;s investment (concentration of credit risk). A single investment&#39;s downgrade after the date of the financial statements generally may not represent a subsequent event requiring disclosure. However, should a government have a concentration of credit risk in a single investment, credit quality rating downgrades after the date of the financial statements may expose the government to a significantly higher level of credit risk that may require disclosure as a subsequent event. For example, a bond downgraded after the date of the financial statements on account of a bankrupt issuer may indicate a large investment loss for the government. If the value of the investment is significant to the government&#39;s total investment portfolio, disclosure of such an event may be required.</div></body></html>
