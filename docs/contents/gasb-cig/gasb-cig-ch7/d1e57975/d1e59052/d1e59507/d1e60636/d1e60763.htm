As a result of differences between estimated useful lives used for depreciation computations and actual useful lives, governments may, in limited cases, have capital assets that are fully depreciated but have not been disposed of. (See also <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_71">Question 7.14.4</span>.) Such capital assets should continue to be reported by the government. Fully depreciated capital assets do not affect the net balance of capital assets. However, the balances of historical cost and accumulated depreciation, which are disclosed separately in the notes to the financial statements and may be displayed separately in the statement of net position, are affected by and should include fully depreciated capital assets that have not been disposed of.</div></body></html>
