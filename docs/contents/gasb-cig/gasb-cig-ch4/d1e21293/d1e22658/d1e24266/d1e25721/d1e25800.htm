However, as discussed in Question 4.33.2, the provisions of Statement 14 should be applied to the financial statements of a nongovernmental component unit when those statements are incorporated into a governmental financial reporting entity. That is, a nongovernmental component unit should include component units of its own based on the criteria in Statement 14, as amended. In addition, the financial statements of a nongovernmental component unit may need to be reformatted to comply with the classification and display requirements in Statement 34, as amended. (See Question 4.33.1 about presenting the financial data of nongovernmental component units on separate pages, and Question 4.33.4 about reformatting.
