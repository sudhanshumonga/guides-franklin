Instead, the pension benefits, if any, that are expected to arise as a result of the projected payment of the compensated absences to the employee should be included in the projection of benefit payments for purposes of Statement 68 and, therefore, would be included in the net pension liability. Payments to the pension plan that are made as a result of the compensated absence would be recognized as an increase in the pension plan’s fiduciary net position in the period in which the payments are due and would, at that time, reduce the employer’s net pension liability.</div></body></html>
