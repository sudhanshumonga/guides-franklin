If a local government levies the tax, should the revenues be disclosed in the notes to the financial statements as net position restricted by enabling legislation? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Although the resources should be reported as restricted net position, they are not restricted by enabling legislation. The local legislation that levies the special property tax may specify that the tax can only be used to pay tort liabilities, but the limitation on how the tax revenues may be used is actually imposed by the state government. As in Question 7.24.21, the purpose restriction is imposed by a party outside of the reporting government, rather than by the reporting government itself.</div></body></html>
