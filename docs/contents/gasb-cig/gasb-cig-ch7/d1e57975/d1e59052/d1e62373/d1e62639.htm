The amount of the &quot;borrowing attributable to the acquisition, construction, or improvement&quot; of a capital asset is the proceeds, rather than the total amount, including interest, that will be paid at maturity. Generally, the accrued interest liability would be included in unrestricted net position. However, if the government has established a &quot;sinking&quot; fund to accumulate cash to pay off the debt at maturity, the accrued interest would be included in (reduce) the same component of net position as the sinking fund resources.</div></body></html>
