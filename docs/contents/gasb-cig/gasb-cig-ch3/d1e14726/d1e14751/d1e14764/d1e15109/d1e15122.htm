For example, payroll costs may be used as a basis for evaluating whether an entity is the predominant participant in a risk financing arrangement it sponsors for workers&#39; compensation coverage. The types of risk coverage provided in a risk financing arrangement for property and liability coverage may also be used as a basis for evaluating whether an entity is the predominant participant. For example, a sponsor that has significant activities with higher risk than other entities—for example, an airport, a landfill, public transit, or a police force—may be the predominant participant.</div></body></html>
