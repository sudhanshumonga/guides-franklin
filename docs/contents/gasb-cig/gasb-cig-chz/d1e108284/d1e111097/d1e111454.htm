The owners of polluted property typically are responsible parties for pollution remediation. Therefore, a lien that has been exercised is an expected recovery and its <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fair value</b> should reduce the measurement of the pollution remediation expense. As discussed in paragraph 19, &quot;if the expected recoveries <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">are</b> realized or realizable, they [also] should be recognized separately from the liability as recovery assets (for example, cash or receivables).&quot; Liens typically are realizable and, therefore, would reduce remediation expense but not the liability.</div></body></html>
