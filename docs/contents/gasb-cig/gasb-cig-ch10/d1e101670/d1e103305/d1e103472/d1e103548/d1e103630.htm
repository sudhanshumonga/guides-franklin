In order to hedge against interest rate risk prior to issuance, the government enters into a forward-starting (in 6 months) 10-year interest rate swap. The bond will carry a semiannual coupon. Likewise, the swap’s payments will be made semiannually. The purpose of the swap is to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the interest payments of the to-be-issued bond. Six months after the inception of the hedge, the government decides to wait six more months to issue the bond. How does the government’s decision to wait 6 months to issue the 10-year bond affect the hedging relationship and the related deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources amount for the 10-year interest rate swap?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—A cash flow hedge of future interest payments is a hedge of a series of expected transactions—in this case, the bond’s 20 coupon payments. The likelihood of whether and when each expected transaction in the series will occur should be determined. Because the bond will not be issued as originally planned, it is probable that the first expected transaction will not occur at the time forecasted. Consequently, hedge accounting should not be applied to that first expected transaction. That is, the first swap payment would not cover the hedged bond, because the bonds will not be issued yet. The fair value changes of the swap attributable to its first payment should be removed from the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources account and reported in the resource flows statement within the investment revenue classification (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.22">paragraph 22b and paragraph 23</span>, as amended). The other 19 forecasted transactions, however, are still expected to occur as forecasted. Hedge accounting may still be applied to the amount in the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources account attributable to those 19 remaining swap payments because they are associated with the expected bond payments.</div></body></html>
