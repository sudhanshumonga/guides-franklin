Questions and answers in Chapters 1–10 further are organized by subtopic, using headings that reflect the structure of the Statement(s) on which the chapters provide guidance. Some headings within the chapters have questions and answers associated with them; other headings do not at this time but are reserved for questions and answers that may be presented in the future. The final chapter in this guide—Chapter Z—provides a location for questions and answers on issues and standards not addressed in other chapters.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">In each chapter, questions and answers are identified by chapter number, heading number, and question number. For example, the third question and answer under the first heading in Chapter 2 would be denoted Question 2.1.3. Chapter Z maintains the same “chapter, heading, question” numbering scheme as Chapters 1–10, but unlike other chapters, the heading number in Chapter Z is the Statement or Interpretation number to which the question primarily relates. For example, the first question and answer in Chapter Z relating to Statement No. 33, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Accounting and Financial Reporting for Nonexchange Transactions</b>, has been given the number Z.33.1, and the first question and answer in Chapter Z addressing Interpretation No. 1, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Demand Bonds Issued by State and Local Governmental Entities</b>, has been given the number Z.I1.1. In Chapter Z, questions and answers under the standards headings are referenced to subtopics in cases in which there are a number of topics addressed in regard to a single standard. As new questions and answers are added in future editions of this guide, each will be included as the next question under the relevant heading in the chapter to which it relates. </div></body></html>
