If a governmental external investment pool includes internal moneys belonging to the pool&#39;s sponsor, should the accounting guidance applicable to governmental external investment pools be followed for the entire pool? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. This pool should follow the governmental external investment pool guidance for money market investments and participating interest-earning investment contracts. Short-term debt investments with remaining maturities of up to 90 days at the date of the financial statements may be reported at amortized cost, provided that the fair value of those investments is not significantly affected by the impairment of the credit standing of the issuer or by other factors. (See Statement 31, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#additional_standards_for_external_investment_pools_and_for_individual_investment_accounts_rec1">paragraph 16</span>.) The pool is not permitted to follow the cost-based standards for money market investments and participating interest-earning investment contracts, even though a portion of the pool represents internal moneys.
