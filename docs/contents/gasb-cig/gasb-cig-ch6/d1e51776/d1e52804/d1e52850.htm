Although Statement 31 implies that the unrealized loss represented by the impairment should be recognized, it does not specifically require it. In fact, paragraph 76 of the Basis for Conclusions states that when there is an impairment, the cost-based measure should be reevaluated. Therefore, professional judgment should be applied in determining the amount and timing of a write-down. For investments that are accounted for using the equity method, paragraph 209 of Statement 62 requires that a decline in the value of an investment that is other than temporary be accounted for in the same manner as a loss in value of other long-term assets.</div></body></html>
