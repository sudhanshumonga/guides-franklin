Required deposits to the fund are calculated by applying a flat rate to each participant&#39;s payroll costs. An account is maintained for each participant and only claims against that participant are paid from its account. If the account has insufficient funds to pay a claim, the participant is required to deposit additional money. The county participates in this fund for its own workers&#39; compensation costs. It has 30 percent of the covered payroll, the local governments have 65 percent of the covered payroll, and not-for-profit organizations have 5 percent of the covered payroll.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> This meets the definition of a public entity risk pool without transfer of risk: The participants are primarily local governmental units, the sponsor (the county) is not the predominant participant, and there is a cooperative effort but no transfer of risk.</div></body></html>
