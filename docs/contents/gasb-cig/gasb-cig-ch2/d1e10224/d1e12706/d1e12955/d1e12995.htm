For example, if a governmental enterprise holds a receivable related to grants from another government, that receivable should not affect cash flows from operating activities; therefore, it should not be a reconciling item. The receivable does, however, have an effect on the noncapital financing activities presentation (assuming the grant is an operating subsidy and not a capital grant). Grant revenues reported as nonoperating income in the flows statement should be adjusted by the receivable amount to arrive at the actual cash flows from the grant.</div></body></html>
