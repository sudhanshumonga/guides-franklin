The corporation is governed by a board appointed by the mayor. The hospital is responsible for selecting its own management and is responsible for its day-to-day operations. The board determines the fee schedule for hospital services, but the budget is subject to the approval of city council. In addition to revenues from patient fees and insurance reimbursements, the hospital receives a significant amount of funding for hospital operations from federal, state, and local aid. The city also provides additional funding for the care of indigent patients. Hospital facilities are generally funded by hospital revenue bonds issued by the city. However, the city is legally responsible for the expenses of planning, establishing, constructing, maintaining, and operating the hospital facilities. If hospital revenues are inadequate to service the debt, the city may take over operations of the hospital to ensure that the debt is paid. The city holds title to the hospital assets.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The municipal hospital is a component unit of the city and would be discretely presented. The hospital board is appointed by the city and the city has the ability to impose its will on the hospital through its budget approval authority. In addition, the responsibility of the city for the expenses relating to the hospital operations and facilities imposes a financial burden on the city.</div></body></html>
