Individual employee accounts are credited with interest at a rate of 5 percent per year, as specified in the benefit terms, and are assessed an administrative fee based on the average balance of assets in the account for the year. During retirement, an employee draws down the balance of the account, with interest continuing to accrue at the specified interest rate. Should this pension be classified as defined benefit or as defined contribution for purposes of applying Statement 68, as amended?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—This pension is defined benefit for purposes of applying Statement 68, as amended. To be classified as a defined contribution pension, paragraph 10 of Statement 68 specifies that all three of the following criteria are required to be met:</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">a.An individual account is provided for each employee.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">b.The plan terms define the amount of contributions that the employer is required to make (or credits that it is required to provide) to an active employee’s account for periods in which the employee renders service.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">c.The pension that an employee will receive will depend only on the contributions (or credits) to the employee’s account, actual earnings on investments of those contributions (or credits), and the effects of forfeitures of contributions (or credits) made for other employees, as well as pension plan administrative costs, that are allocated to the employee’s account.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Although the pension provided in this question meets the first two of these criteria, it does not meet the third criterion because the interest credited to an employee’s account is based on a specified rate regardless of the actual earnings on the underlying investments made with the assets in the account. Because the pension does not meet all three of the criteria identified in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs68__par__10">paragraph 10</span> of Statement 68 to be classified as defined contribution, it should be classified as defined benefit for purposes of applying Statement 68, as amended.</div></body></html>
