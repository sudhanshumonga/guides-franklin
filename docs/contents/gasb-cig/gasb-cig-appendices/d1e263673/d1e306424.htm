The measure should be calculated and disclosed, regardless of (a) the amount recognized as OPEB expense (in proprietary and fiduciary fund financial statements and in government-wide financial statements) or expenditures (in governmental fund financial statements) on the accrual or modified accrual basis and (b) the amount paid in relation to the employer&#39;s annual required contributions (ARC) in accordance with the parameters. <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">When an employer has no net OPEB obligation, annual OPEB cost is equal to the ARC.</b> </div><div class="ps_numbered_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_numbered_para_1"> 2.A net OPEB obligation is the cumulative difference since the effective date of Statement 45 between annual OPEB cost and an employer&#39;s contributions to a plan, including the OPEB liability (asset) at transition (if any) and excluding (a) short-term differences, as defined in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#calculation_of_interest_on_the_net_opeb_obligation_and_the_adjustment_to_the_arc_rec1">paragraph 14</span> of Statement 45, and (b) unpaid contributions that have been converted to OPEB-related debt.

When a net OPEB obligation has an asset [negative] balance, the interest adjustment should be <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">deducted </b>from and the ARC adjustment should be <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">added </b>to the ARC, to determine annual OPEB cost.)</div><div class="ps_numbered_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_numbered_para_1">3.When a contribution deficiency occurs, the next and subsequent ARCs include an amount for amortization of the deficiency (except for short-term differences, as defined in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#calculation_of_interest_on_the_net_opeb_obligation_and_the_adjustment_to_the_arc_rec1">paragraph 14</span> of Statement 45). The same accounting parameters apply for amortizing contribution deficiencies as for any other actuarial loss. The amount included in the ARC for amortization of the deficiency depends on the amortization methodology applied and generally is not precisely determinable. The accounting adjustments are designed to <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">estimate </b>the amortization amount, remove it from the ARC, and add back an appropriate amount for interest on the net OPEB obligation. The purpose of the interest and ARC adjustments is to avoid &quot;double-counting&quot; annual OPEB cost and liabilities. Without the adjustments, annual OPEB cost and the net OPEB obligation (liability) would be overstated by the portion of the amortization amount previously recognized in annual OPEB cost. With the adjustments, annual OPEB cost should be approximately equal to the ARC that would have been charged if all prior ARCs had been paid in full, plus one year&#39;s interest on the net OPEB obligation. The interest is an estimate of the investment earnings lost to the plan on the contributions that were not made. Making the adjustments also allows the employer to return to reporting annual OPEB cost equal to the ARC, either when amortization of the deficiency is complete or earlier upon full payment of the net OPEB obligation including interest.</div><div class="ps_numbered_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_numbered_para_1">4.Each year&#39;s adjustments should be calculated using the same amortization method, period, and assumptions applied in calculating the ARC <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">for that year.</b> Each year&#39;s adjustments apply only for that year; there is no amortization schedule to follow. In accordance with the parameters, the method should be either level percentage of projected payroll (level percent) or level dollar. The period should be the period applied by the actuary for amortizing actuarial experience gains and losses. In calculating the amortization amount, the actuary uses an amortization factor that incorporates the period and a discount rate. When level dollar is used, the discount rate is the investment return rate (assumed return on the investments that are expected to be used to finance the payment of benefits). When level percent is used, the discount rate is slightly less than the difference between the investment return rate and the inflation rate (assumed payroll growth rate). (One formula for calculating a level percent discount rate is: [(1 + investment return rate) / (1 + inflation rate)] – 1. For example, if the investment return and inflation assumptions are 5.5 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively, the discount rate is [1.055/1.045] – 1, or approximately 0.96 percent.)</div><div class="ps_numbered_para_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_numbered_para_1">5.To make the adjustments, the financial statement preparer needs to know the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">investment return rate </b>and the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">amortization factor </b>applicable to the year for which the adjustments are made.
