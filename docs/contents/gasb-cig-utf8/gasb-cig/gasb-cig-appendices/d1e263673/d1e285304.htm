Case 13a illustrates certain provisions of Statement 61. Cases 20–28 illustrate how the criteria in paragraph 5 of Statement 39, would be applied. That paragraph amends Statement 14 by providing specific criteria to consider when a potential component unit is not fiscally dependent on a primary government and the primary government does not appoint a voting majority of the potential component unit's governing board.</div><div class="p ps_para_1_sm-tab" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="b ph bold display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Note: </b>In arriving at conclusions for these cases, all financial benefit and burden relationships were considered material from the standpoint of the primary government or the potential component unit, unless otherwise noted.</div></body></html>
