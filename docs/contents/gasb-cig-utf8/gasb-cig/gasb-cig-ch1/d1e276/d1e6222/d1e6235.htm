Governments are not required to segregate investments denominated in foreign currencies from their other investment risk disclosures. Governments may choose to include the interest rate risk of such investments within their interest rate risk disclosures or may choose to present all of the investment risks that the foreign-denominated investment bears within the foreign currency risk disclosure. For example, a government may choose to display its exposure to interest rate risk using the specific identification method. In that case, the government may list each foreign investment by investment type, the currency in which they are denominated, the maturity of each investment, and the investments' fair values.</div></body></html>
