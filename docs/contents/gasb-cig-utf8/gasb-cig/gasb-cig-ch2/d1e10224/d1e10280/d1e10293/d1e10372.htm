Even though that requirement is stated in terms that apply to reporting governmental activities, the standard should be comparably applied, in substance, to the BTA model. That is, component unit data should be included by discrete presentation in the statements of financial position (statement of net position/balance sheet) and changes in financial position (statement of revenues, expenses, and changes in net position). Paragraph 125 does not include a requirement to display component unit cash flow information.</div></body></html>
