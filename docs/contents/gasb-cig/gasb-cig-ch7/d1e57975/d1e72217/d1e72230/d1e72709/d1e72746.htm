For example, a legal provision may require the automatic rolling forward of appropriations to cover prior-year encumbrances. In essence, the adopted budget includes a provision to cover prior-year encumbrances in whatever amounts they may be. The amounts will likely be known (or can be reasonably estimated) by the time the financial statements are issued after the year-end.</div></body></html>
