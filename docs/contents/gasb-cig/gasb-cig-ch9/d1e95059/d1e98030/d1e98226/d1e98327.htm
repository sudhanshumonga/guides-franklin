Governments may be able to obtain other information from the state department that still will help a user to understand the degree to which a government&#39;s economy is or is not dependent on a small number of businesses:</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">•The names of the largest employers without the specific employment numbers, but with general ranges (for instance, 5,000 or more, 2,500–4,999, 1,000–2,499, and so on).

Ultimately, if principal employer information cannot be obtained, a government should consider what other information could be provided that would help the user to understand the degree of concentration in the jurisdiction&#39;s employment base. One possible type of information might be total employment organized by type of employer (for example, government, military, retail, manufacturing, finance, and so on).</div></body></html>
