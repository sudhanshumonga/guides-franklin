Because the general fund can be “reimbursed” only for actual claims expenditures, the $200,000 should be reported as transfers in from the enterprise fund and special revenue fund to comply with paragraph 64 of Statement 10, as amended. Statement 10, as amended, does not specify how the government should determine what portion of the transfers is from each fund. For purposes of this example, the amount has been allocated to the two funds after deducting actual claims costs related to those funds. For example, the $600,000 allocation to the water utility less $500,000 in actual claims expense results in a transfer out of $100,000. The entries in each fund would be:</div><div class="ps_graphic_container p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_graphic_container"> <span class="placement-inline align-"><img class="cd_online_ image" src="" data-attr-outputclass="cd;online;" data-attr-placement="inline"/></span> </div></body></html>
