Differences, if any, result primarily from deposits in transit and outstanding checks. The bank balance—the amount for which the financial institutions actually are liable as of the government&#39;s financial reporting date—is the government&#39;s risk exposure. This disclosure is intended to communicate the credit risk associated with deposits at financial institutions. Classifying deposits based on the book balance would not achieve the objective of this disclosure.</div></body></html>
