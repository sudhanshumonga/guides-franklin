Should some or all of the liability be considered &quot;capital-related debt&quot; for purposes of calculating the net position components?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs18_par._8">Paragraph 8</span> of Statement 18 states that equipment and facilities included in the estimated total current cost of closure and postclosure care should not be reported as capital assets but, rather, should be reported as a reduction of the accrued liability for MSWLF closure and postclosure care when they are acquired. Therefore, because the closure and postclosure liability already has been reduced by the cost of capital assets acquired, the remaining liability cannot be attributed to the purchase or construction of capital assets. The liability would be included in the calculation of unrestricted net position, or if the liability is funded and the assets are restricted, it would reduce restricted net position. </div></body></html>
