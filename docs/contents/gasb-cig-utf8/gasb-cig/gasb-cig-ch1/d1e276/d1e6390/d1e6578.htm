However, it permits disclosure in the notes to the financial statements, provided the nature of those amounts and their relationship to the net change in the fair value of investments also is disclosed. That additional disclosure, which also is required if realized gains and losses are displayed in the separate reports of governmental external investment pools, is intended to inform financial statement users about the differences between measurements made based on the cost basis and those made on the fair value basis. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasbs31_par._15" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs31_par._15">Paragraph 15</span> of Statement 31 describes the required disclosures.</div></body></html>
