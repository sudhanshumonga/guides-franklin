Following the month of collection, the proceeds are remitted to the appropriate districts. While the county holds the proceeds, the moneys are invested in the county&#39;s external investment pool. The districts receive investment income but do not participate in investment losses of the pool. Are the districts participants in a governmental external investment pool? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. In the view of the districts, the moneys held by the county are a receivable, not an investment. Receivables are not covered by Statement 31, as amended. See <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#standards_of_governmental_accounting_and_financial_reporting_26_rec1">paragraph 2</span>, as amended, and the definition of <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">debt security</b> in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs31_par._22_rec5">paragraph 22</span> of the Statement. Whether the districts receive any investment income on their invested balances does not affect this analysis. The county should report in an agency fund a liability to the districts and should value the investments purchased with the districts&#39; moneys according to Statement 31, as amended. If the values of the investments fall below the county&#39;s liability, the county should evaluate its liability in the context of its legal responsibilities.</div></body></html>
