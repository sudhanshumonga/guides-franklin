The fact that a public entity was created by a state government is not a factor in this presentation. The basic concept of overlapping governments relates to geographic area.

The revenue rates of <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">state-wide</b> public authorities would not be included as overlapping rates in a local, county, or regional government&#39;s statistical section.
