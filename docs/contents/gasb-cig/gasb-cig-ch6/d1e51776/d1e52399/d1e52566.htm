If the government chooses to report the land and mineral rights aggregated in a single unit of account, the land and the mineral rights (as one unit of account) should be classified as a capital asset. If the government separates the land and mineral rights, the land should be reported as a capital asset (the primary purpose of acquiring the land is conservation instead of income or profit). In this circumstance, the mineral rights should be evaluated in the context of whether they meet the definition of an investment in Statement 72 or should be reported as another type of asset.</div></body></html>
