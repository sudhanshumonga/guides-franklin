The purpose of the authority is to provide an alternative source of financing for not-for-profit and public health institutions facilities and to carry out certain health studies and make recommendations to the state legislature. The governor appoints the governing board of the authority. Board members may be removed only for cause. However, the state can unilaterally abolish the authority and replace it with a similar organization. The authority selects its own management and controls its day-to-day operations. The authority is authorized to issue tax-exempt bonds in its own name, which are payable solely from payments received from borrowing institutions. In the past, the state has assumed payment on a loan with similar characteristics, even though the enabling legislation specifically provides that the state has no obligation for the debts of the authority.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The authority is a component unit of the state and should be discretely presented.The state appoints a voting majority of the governing board of the health facilities authority. The authority of the state to unilaterally abolish the organization would be a manifestation of imposition of will and would create financial accountability for the authority. In addition, a financial burden would be imposed on the state if the state is obligated in some manner for the debt of the authority as a result of the potential for the state to assume defaulted debt of the authority. The criteria of Statement 14, paragraph 33g, provide that a primary government would be obligated in some manner for the debt of another organization if &quot;legal decisions within the state or previous actions by the primary government related to actual or potential defaults on another organization&#39;s debt make it <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">probable</b> that the primary government will assume responsibility for the debt in the event of default.&quot; However, the debt of the authority would be clearly presented as that of the authority and not as debt of the state. The authority provides services to the health institutions rather than to the state itself, and the total debt outstanding, including leases, of authority is not expected to be repaid entirely or almost entirely with the state’s resources; therefore, it would not meet the blending criteria and should be discretely presented.</div></body></html>
