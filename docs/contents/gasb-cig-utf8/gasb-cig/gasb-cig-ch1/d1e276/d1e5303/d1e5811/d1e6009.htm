CMOs are mortgage-backed securities that are composed of several classes of bonds all backed by the same mortgage collateral. These classes of bonds are known as tranches—related securities offered at the same time, but having different risks, rewards, or maturities. For example, a CMO structure might have tranches with 1-year, 2-year, 5-year, and 20-year maturities. Tranches that are not generally highly sensitive to changes in interest rates are planned amortization class (PAC) tranches, some targeted amortization class (TAC) tranches, and sequential-pay CMO tranches.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">PAC tranches use a mechanism similar to a "sinking fund" to establish a fixed principal payment schedule that directs cash-flow irregularities caused by faster- or slower-than-expected prepayments away from the PAC tranche and toward another "companion" or "support" tranche. Accordingly, the payment schedule, yield, and average life of the tranche are expected to remain stable until maturity. PAC payment schedules are protected by priorities that ensure that PAC payments are met first out of principal payments from the underlying mortgage loans. These characteristics of PAC tranches make them fairly insensitive to interest rate changes that may cause the underlying mortgages to be prepaid. TAC tranches are similar to PAC tranches, although they specify a prepayment rate at which the principal payment schedule is fixed.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Sequential-pay CMOs have tranches that pay in a strict sequence. Each tranche receives regular interest payments, but the principal payments received are made to the first tranche alone, until it is completely retired. Once the first tranche is retired, principal payments are applied to the second tranche until it too is fully retired, and the process continues until the last tranche is retired. Generally the first few tranches in a sequential-pay CMO, similar to PAC tranches, are fairly insensitive to interest rate changes because even if the underlying mortgage holders choose to prepay, the first tranche will continue to receive principal payments from other tranches until the first is retired.</div></body></html>
