Agency A, accounted for in the state&#39;s general fund, capitalizes outlays in excess of $100,000, while Agency B, a larger activity that is accounted for in an enterprise fund, employs a $700,000 capitalization threshold. Agency B transfers a 1-year-old piece of equipment with an initial cost of $570,000 to Agency A. How should that transaction be recognized? How should the transaction be recognized if Agency A transferred the equipment to Agency B? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs48_par_15">Paragraph 15</span> of Statement 48 requires that an asset received in an intra-entity transaction be reported by the recipient at the transferor&#39;s carrying value. In the first scenario, even though the cost of the equipment transferred exceeds the capitalization threshold of Agency A, it has a carrying value of zero and, thus, the equipment should continue to be reflected at that value in the state&#39;s statement of net position. If the two agencies are discretely presented component units, rather than part of the primary government, and they each presented separate financial statements, the transaction would still be an intra-entity transfer of assets. However, neither Agency A nor Agency B would present the transaction in their separately issued financial statements because the carry-over basis for the assets transferred has a value of zero.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">In the reverse situation, Agency B would recognize the receipt of the asset at the carrying value of the equipment (see <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_335">Question 7.74.4</span>) and simultaneously recognize an expense, rather than a capital asset in accordance with its higher capitalization threshold. If the two agencies are discreetly presented component units and they each presented separate financial statements, Agency A would report the disposal at carrying value as an expense, and Agency B would thus recognize the receipt of the asset at the carrying value of Agency A and simultaneously recognize an expense because of its higher capitalization threshold. </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If discretely presented component unit Agency A instead paid discretely presented component unit Agency B $400,000 for the equipment, the transaction would still be an intra-entity transfer of assets, and the carry-over basis (zero) for the assets transferred is still applicable. In this scenario, component unit Agency A would report the $400,000 paid as an expense, component unit Agency B would recognize revenue, and the financial statement of the reporting entity would include the disclosures required by paragraph 128 of Statement 34.
