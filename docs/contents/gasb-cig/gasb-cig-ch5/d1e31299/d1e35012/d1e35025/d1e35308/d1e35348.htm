Is this provision consistent with the criterion in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs68__par__4">paragraph 4a</span> of Statement 68 regarding the irrevocability of contributions?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. A provision for the reversion of plan assets to an employer prior to the point at which all obligations associated with the plan have been fulfilled is not consistent with the criterion related to irrevocability of contributions. Pensions that are provided through a plan that has such a provision are not within the scope of Statement 68, and an employer should report those pensions by applying the requirements of Statement 73.</div></body></html>
