Each of these modules will be developed on an individual timetable and, as a result, will become operational at different points. Should the guidance in Statement 51 for reporting outlays associated with the development of internally generated computer software be applied to each individual module of the ERP system or, instead, to the ERP system as a whole? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>The guidance for reporting outlays associated with the development of internally generated computer software in Statement 51 is based on the stages of software development. Generally, in the above circumstance, each module will have its own development cycle, particularly as it relates to application development-stage and post-implementation/operation-stage activities described in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs51_par__10">paragraph 10</span> of Statement 51.
