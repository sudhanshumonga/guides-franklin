The operating revenue (water charges) is much larger than any of the government&#39;s other own-source revenues—water charges represent 50 percent of the government&#39;s total own-source revenues and its property tax represents 25 percent. Should the government present revenue capacity schedules for the water charges rather than its property tax, which otherwise would be its largest own-source revenue? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—A government&#39;s &quot;most significant own-source revenue&quot; often is interpreted as being the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">largest</b> of its own-source revenues. However, as it relates to own-source revenue, &quot;significance&quot; may have both quantitative and <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">qualitative</b> aspects. For example, the significance to a government of its water charges may not solely be a product of the overall magnitude of the revenues but also may relate to the degree to which those revenues support the government in general. If the enterprise is essentially self-sustaining and provides no financial support to the government as a whole, then it might be reasonable to conclude that the own-source revenue most significant to the government and the readers of its financial report is the largest revenue the government levies for its general support.</div></body></html>
