That arrangement is tantamount to a legally binding agreement between the government and the resource providers (the taxpayers) establishing limitations on how those funds can be used. The government generally cannot unilaterally decide to do something else with those resources. Furthermore, the government can be compelled by an external party—such as citizens, public interest groups, or the judiciary—to use the resources only for the purposes specified by the enabling legislation. (See Question 7.24.12 about subsequent amendments to enabling legislation.) This is different from situations when a government passes a law that says the use of existing resources is limited to a specific purpose or &quot;earmarks&quot; a portion of an existing revenue source. In those two situations the government does not obtain funds under restrictive conditions; thus, the limitations imposed do not create restrictions. (See Questions <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_chapter_7_question_192">7.35.2–7.35.4</span> about reporting restricted general revenues.) </div></body></html>
