A recipient government has administrative involvement if it determines eligible secondary recipients or projects, even if using grantor-established criteria. Therefore, because of their administrative involvement with Pell Grant requirements and because Pell Grants are nonexchange transactions, public institutions should record Pell Grant receipts as nonoperating revenues in their financial statements, and any amounts applied to student receivable accounts should be recorded as scholarship discounts or allowances.</div></body></html>
