The objective of the distribution is that each individual placement is under the various separate institutions’ insured limits, providing FDIC insurance for the aggregate deposit. For example, if the FDIC-insured limit per bank deposit cannot exceed $250,000 and a government has a $960,000 deposit, a deposit placement service spreads the government’s $960,000 deposit into 4 CDs at 4 different banks in the amount of $240,000 each, covering the entire deposit by FDIC deposit insurance.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">CDs that are acquired through a placement service should be evaluated as deposits. Whether a deposit is FDIC insured depends on whether the terms and agreements surrounding the deposit comply with the requirements of FDIC insurance. Those requirements include, for example, documentation and disclosure requirements, such as the manner in which the records of the custodian or sub-custodian institution identify the depositor. The evaluation should consider whether the government also has other deposits at institutions that participate in the deposit placement service such that the government’s total deposits at any institution might exceed the FDIC-insured limit.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Deposits held overnight in the relationship bank (the bank that receives a deposit and returns that deposit to the depositor) prior to the issuance of a CD through a placement service, or after maturity but before being withdrawn by the depositor, may not be covered by FDIC insurance. In those cases, the evaluation of custodial credit risk should consider whether the deposits are collateralized or otherwise insured. Deposits that are neither insured nor collateralized as specified by paragraph 8 of Statement 40 should be addressed in a custodial credit risk disclosure.</div></body></html>
