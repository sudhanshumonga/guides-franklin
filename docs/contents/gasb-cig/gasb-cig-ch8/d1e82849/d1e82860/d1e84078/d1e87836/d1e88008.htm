For example, in a cost-sharing employer&#39;s financial reporting period ended June 30, 20X5, the employer pays to the plan the contractually required contributions for the 12 monthly pay periods from June 20X4 through May 20X5. Of the total contributions paid, the amounts paid for the 11 pay periods from July 20X4 through May 20X5 are the assessed contributions for pay periods that fall within the current financial reporting period. The employer in the example should include the contributions paid for those 11 pay periods as the amounts &quot;contributed to the plan&quot; in the determination of OPEB expenditures for the period.
