For certain employers (&quot;nonpool employers&quot;), the PERS maintains separate asset accounts. The assets and obligations of other employers (&quot;pool employers&quot;) are pooled. How should this arrangement be classified for purposes of applying Statement 68, as amended?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—If the assets of each of the nonpool employers cannot legally be used to pay benefits to the employees of any other employer, the portion of the trust that is being used to administer benefits to the employees of the nonpool employers is a separate (agent multiple-employer) plan, and nonpool employers should apply the requirements of Statement 68 for agent employers. In this circumstance, the portion of the trust that is being used to administer the benefits of the employees of pool employers is a cost-sharing multiple-employer plan, and pool employers should apply the requirements of Statement 68, as amended, for cost-sharing employers. If, however, the assets in the trust may legally be used to pay benefits to the employees of any of the employers (pooled or nonpooled), the arrangement is one cost-sharing multiple-employer plan for financial reporting purposes, and all of the employers should apply the requirements of Statement 68, as amended, for cost-sharing employers.</div></body></html>
