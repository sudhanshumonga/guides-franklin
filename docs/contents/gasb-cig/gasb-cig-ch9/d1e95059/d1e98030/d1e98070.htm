For instance, a school district may cover all or a portion of the area of multiple local governments; furthermore, the school district covers only a portion of the county within which it resides. For what jurisdiction should it provide demographic and economic information? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs44_par._33">Paragraph 33</span> of Statement 44 states that a government should present &quot;the data that are the most specific to that particular government.&quot; There are several options for reporting on jurisdictions for which information cannot be obtained.

This should be done, however, only if the government believes the county information and its trend over the 10-year period is representative of the conditions and experience of the government&#39;s jurisdiction. The information should be clearly labeled as pertaining to the county, rather than the government itself.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">•The government could present information for the individual governments with which it substantially overlaps. The information should be clearly labeled as pertaining to these other jurisdictions, rather than the government itself. If the government chooses to aggregate the information for the overlapping governments to produce single indicators for the government, the schedule should note this fact and describe how the aggregation was accomplished.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">•The government could estimate information for its jurisdiction based on the information for other jurisdictions.
