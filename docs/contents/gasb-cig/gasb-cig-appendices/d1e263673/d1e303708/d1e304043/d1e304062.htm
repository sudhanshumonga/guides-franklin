These component units are so intertwined with the County that they are, in substance, the same as the County and, therefore, are blended and reported as if they were part of the County. The County Board of Supervisors also serves as the governing board for the Redevelopment Agency, the Sewer Maintenance District, and the Flood Control District. Although the board members of the Public Facilities Corporation are appointed by the County Board, the corporation exists solely to finance the acquisition and construction of equipment and facilities for the County.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div><div class="table-headcount-0"><div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="underline ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="underline">Component Unit</b> </div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Included in the</b> <b class="underline ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="underline">Reporting Entity Because:</b> </div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="bold ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="bold">Separate</b> <b class="underline ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="underline">Financial Statements</b> </div></div></div><div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">County Redevelopment Agency (CRA): conducts capital improvement projects for sewer and storm-drainage systems and makes community improvements such as youth and community facilities, sidewalks, and graffiti abatement</div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Board of Supervisors composes; board of CRA</div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Available at the County Clerk&#39;s Office in the Courthouse or at www.CRA.gov </div></div></div><div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div></div><div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">County Sewer Maintenance District (CSMD): develops, expands, and maintains the CSMD wastewater treatment and disposal facility</div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Board of Supervisors composes board of CSMD</div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Available at the County Clerk&#39;s Office in the Courthouse or at www.CSMD.gov </div></div></div><div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div></div><div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">County Flood Control District (CFCD): provides flood control–related services to County residents</div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Board of Supervisors composes board of CFCD</div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Available at the County Clerk&#39;s Office in the Courthouse or at www.CFCD.gov </div></div></div><div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"></div></div></div><div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">County Public Facilities Corporation (CPFC): acquires equipment and facilities financed by the proceeds of borrowings for lease to the County</div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">County appoints and may remove members of board of CPFC</div></div><div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">CPFC Offices6766 Mesquite Dr. County Seat, ST 92277 or at www.CPFC.gov </div></div></div></div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">1-B.Basis of Presentation, Basis of Accounting</div><div class="ps_tertiary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_tertiary_heading">Basis of Presentation</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Government-wide Statements:</b> The statement of net position and the statement of activities display information about the primary government (the County) and its component units.

These statements distinguish between the <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">governmental</b> and <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">business-type activities</b> of the County.

Program revenues include (a) fees, fines, and charges paid by the recipients of goods or services offered by the programs and (b) grants and contributions restricted to meeting the operational or capital requirements of a particular program.

Revenues are recorded when earned and expenses are recorded at the time liabilities are incurred, regardless of when the related cash flows take place. Nonexchange transactions, in which the County gives (or receives) value without directly receiving (or giving) equal value in exchange, include property taxes, grants, entitlements, and donations. On an accrual basis, revenue from property taxes is recognized in the fiscal year for which the taxes are levied. Revenue from grants, entitlements, and donations is recognized in the fiscal year in which all eligibility requirements have been satisfied.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Governmental Fund Financial Statements</b>. Governmental funds are reported using the current financial resources measurement focus and the modified accrual basis of accounting. Under this method, revenues are recognized when measurable and available. The County considers all revenues reported in the governmental funds to be available if the revenues are collected within sixty days after year-end. Property taxes, sales taxes, franchise taxes, licenses, and interest are considered to be susceptible to accrual. Expenditures are recorded when the related fund liability is incurred, except for principal and interest on general long-term debt, claims and judgments, and compensated absences, which are recognized as expenditures to the extent they have matured. Capital asset acquisitions are reported as expenditures in governmental funds. Proceeds of general long-term debt and financing from capital leases are reported as other financing sources.</div><div class="ps_secondary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">1-C.Assets, Liabilities, and Net Position</div><div class="ps_tertiary_heading p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_tertiary_heading">Deposits and Investments</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">The cash balances of substantially all funds are pooled and invested by the County Treasurer for the purpose of increasing earnings through investment activities.
