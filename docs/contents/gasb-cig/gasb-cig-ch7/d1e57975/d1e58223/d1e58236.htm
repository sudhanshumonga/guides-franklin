Some information is required to be reported because of its <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">quantitative</b> significance; other information may be required for <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">qualitative</b> reasons rather than its monetary significance. Materiality determinations, both quantitative and qualitative, made in preparing financial statements should be responsive to, and consistent with, those requirements. That is, requirements in Statement 34 to provide separate financial statements or information are based on the belief that particular reporting units are &quot;material.&quot;</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._14">Paragraph 14</span> of Statement 34 reinforces the concept in Statement No. 14, <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">The Financial Reporting Entity, </b>that the focus of government-wide statements should be on the primary government—as opposed to its component units or the financial reporting entity as a whole. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._15">Paragraph 15</span> of Statement 34 establishes that a primary government is composed of its governmental activities and its business-type activities, and that financial statements for each of those two types of activities should be displayed. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#focus_on_major_funds_rec1">Paragraph 75</span> of that Statement states that the focus of governmental and proprietary fund financial statements is on <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">major</b> funds; that paragraph requires governments to separately report the financial statements or information of certain individual governmental and enterprise funds (based on quantitative measures detailed in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._76">paragraph 76</span>, as amended). The significance of governmental and business-type activities and major funds is further emphasized in the note disclosure requirements of Statement 34, as amended. <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#basic_financial_statements_notes_to_the_financial_statements_rec1">Paragraph 113</span> states that the notes to financial statements &quot;should focus on the primary government—specifically, its governmental activities, business-type activities, major funds, and nonmajor funds in the aggregate.&quot;</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Despite the primacy of governmental activities, business-type activities, and major funds, Statement 34 nevertheless provides display requirements for <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">all</b> funds and activities. Paragraph 75 states that nonmajor governmental and enterprise funds should be aggregated and each aggregation should be displayed in a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">single</b> column in the appropriate fund financial statements. In addition, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#separate_presentation_of_internal_service_funds_rec1">paragraph 96</span> requires governments to use a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">single</b> column in the proprietary fund financial statements to display internal service funds. Finally, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#required_financial_statements_fiduciary_funds_and_similar_component_units__rec1">paragraph 106</span> requires that fiduciary fund financial statements include a <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">separate</b> column for each fiduciary fund type. These display requirements, while appearing to similarly require &quot;separate&quot; reporting, differ from those for major funds and governmental and business-type activities because they address how to report the financial statements of funds that are <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">outside</b> of the primary focuses discussed above.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The components of the remaining fund information—nonmajor funds, internal service funds, and fiduciary funds—may or may not be quantitatively material.
