The relationship between the investor in an open-end mutual fund and the investment company is a direct contractual relationship. There is no document or other evidence of ownership that, if lost or stolen, would result in a loss to the investor. Therefore, the government's investment is not directly exposed to custodial credit risk. Certainly, the fund securities that provide the basis for the participant's income and protection of its principal can be exposed to custodial credit risk. However, that is the <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">fund's</b> risk, not the individual investor's risk.
