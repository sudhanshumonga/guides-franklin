The net settlement characteristic is met if one of the parties of the contract is required to deliver an asset that is readily convertible to cash (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.13">paragraph 13c</span> of Statement 53). Would the delivery of the swap contract meet the net settlement characteristic by being considered <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">readily convertible to cash?</b> </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. The swap contract is considered <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">readily convertible to cash</b>. The phrase <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">readily convertible to cash</b> includes a security or commodity traded in an active market. A security or commodity that is publicly traded but for which the market is not very active is readily convertible to cash if the number of units of the security or commodity to be exchanged is small relative to the daily transaction volume. That same security or commodity may not be readily convertible to cash if the number of units to be exchanged is large relative to the daily transaction volume. The ability to use an equity security without a readily determinable fair value or a commodity without an active market—such as a unique grade of coal—as collateral in a borrowing does not, in and of itself, mean that the security or the commodity is readily convertible to cash.</div></body></html>
