What if a government invests in a security that receives split ratings? That is, NRSROs issued different ratings on the same security. What credit quality disclosures should be made?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—There are several recognized NRSROs at this time. Currently, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) reviews the qualifications of applicant credit quality rating firms to determine if they meet the criteria for becoming an NRSRO. Statement 40, as amended, does not specifically address whether the credit quality ratings of all NRSROs need to be disclosed.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Many securities have ratings from more than one NRSRO, and sometimes those ratings differ. When multiple ratings exist and the government is aware of the different ratings, the rating indicative of the greatest degree of risk should be presented. However, a government may also choose to disclose additional credit quality ratings, thereby presenting the user with additional credit risk information from which to ascertain the credit risk of the investment.</div></body></html>
