Statement 9, as amended, requires articulation between the statement of cash flows and the statement of net position/balance sheet, possibly requiring changes to certain statement of net position/balance sheet presentations. Paragraph 8 of Statement 9 states, &quot;The total amounts of cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and end of the period shown in the statement of cash flows should be easily traceable to similarly titled line items or subtotals shown in the statements of financial position as of those dates.&quot; Therefore, it would be inconsistent to include in the caption &quot;cash and cash equivalents&quot; items that do not meet the definition.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Statements 3 and 40, as amended, do not require articulation between the required disclosures and the statement of net position/balance sheet. However, some do trace the balances in the Statements 3 and 40 disclosures, as amended, to the statement of net position/balance sheet presentation. Because Statement 9, as amended, changes that presentation, a reconciliation may be necessary when tracing these disclosures to the statement of net position/balance sheet.
