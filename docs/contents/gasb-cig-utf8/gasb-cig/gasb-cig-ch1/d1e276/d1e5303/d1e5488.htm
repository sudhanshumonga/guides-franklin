How does the reset impact the government's interest rate risk disclosure?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Statement 40 defines interest rate risk as "the risk that changes in interest rates will adversely affect the fair value of an investment." The fair value of repricing securities (debt investments with a coupon that resets on a specific date or frequency) is generally less susceptible to fluctuations in value because the variable-rate coupon resets back to the market rate on a periodic basis. Interest rate risk disclosure methods that consider investment time horizons and maturities (weighted average maturity, segmented time distribution, and duration) generally make assumptions regarding the maturity of the investment for interest rate risk purposes. Effectively at each reset date, a debt investment with a variable-rate coupon reprices back to par value, thus eliminating the interest rate risk on the investment at each periodic reset. Similar to the actual maturity of the investment, the debt investment's price will not fluctuate when the coupon rate is equal to the market rate of interest, and consequently many governments may assume that the maturity for interest rate risk purposes is the length of time until the next reset date rather than the stated maturity. In accordance with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._15" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs40_par._15">paragraph 15</span> of Statement 40, governments should disclose any maturity assumptions that affect interest rate risk information.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">However, governments holding investments with variable-rate coupons should consider the effects of caps, floors, and collars (a combination of caps and floors) in the determination of the investments' maturities. For example, a government holds a variable-rate investment having a 3-month coupon reset with a cap of 4 percent. If interest rates at the time of the reset were 5 percent, the cap would prevent the investment from repricing to par, causing the fair value of the investment to remain below par and take on the characteristics of a fixed-rate bond, should interest rates remain over the cap of 4 percent.</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Both the repricing of the debt investment's coupon to the market rate and the shorter assumed maturity of the instrument tend to lower the magnitude of the interest rate risk associated with the debt investment. However, as previously noted, variable-rate investments with coupon resets may also be coupled with a cap, a floor, or a collar. Such features may prevent reset to par at each reset date, both affecting the maturity and the fair value of the investment. A government should analyze the effects of these features on the fair value of its investments when determining interest rate risk.</div></body></html>
