Individual securities held in the portfolio may be highly sensitive to changes in interest rates, and a government should consider the effect of those instruments on the interest rate risk of the entire portfolio when determining appropriate disclosures. The interest rate risk disclosure methods outlined in paragraph 15 of Statement 40 generally consider the effects of investments that either increase or decrease a government’s exposure to interest rate risk. For example, a government may choose to present its interest rate risk using the weighted average maturity of the government’s portfolio, thereby taking into consideration the aggregate effect of all investments on the government’s interest rate risk. Governments holding investments that are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates also should analyze the effect of such instruments on the interest rate risk of the entire portfolio, making appropriate disclosures of the terms of those instruments if the terms are not expressed in the interest rate risk disclosure method selected. For example, a government holds a variable-rate investment with a coupon set at 2.25 times the 3-month LIBOR. The effective duration of the portfolio, including the variable-rate investment, is 5.46 years, whereas the effective duration of the portfolio without the variable-rate investment is 4.87 years. The variable-rate investment serves to increase the government’s exposure to interest rate risk, which is communicated in the interest rate risk disclosure method selected from paragraph 15 of Statement 40. Additional terms and the fair value of the investment should be disclosed in accordance with paragraph 16 of Statement 40, as amended, and Statement 72.</div></body></html>
