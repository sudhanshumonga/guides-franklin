A policy or practice of foreclosure is not, in and of itself, evidence that the government will be named. If the government cannot be compelled by an external party to foreclose on polluted property, no obligating event has occurred. An obligating event occurs when the government forecloses, at which time the state law becomes applicable and names the government as a responsible party or PRP.</div></body></html>
