The authority can enter into contracts and can sue and be sued. It is also able to issue revenue bonds but currently has no debt outstanding. The authority is governed by a seven-member board consisting of the mayor of the county seat, the mayor of another large municipality in the county, a member appointed by the county board, a member appointed by the board of parks and recreation (a seven-member board appointed by the county board), the chairman of the county board, and two members appointed by a majority vote of the other five.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab">Historically, the county has levied a 3 percent hotel–motel tax to support tourism. The county recently increased this tax to 8 percent, with the percent increase dedicated for the benefit of the coliseum and exhibition hall authority. Through a contractual agreement between the county and the authority, the entire amount of the hotel–motel tax is collected by the county and paid to the authority through a bond trustee. The contract provides for the authority to return a portion of the hotel–motel tax to the county, if funds are available after the payment of the authority&#39;s debt service and operating expenses. This payment is to restore the county&#39;s 3% hotel–motel tax revenue.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The coliseum and exhibit hall authority is a component unit of the county and would be discretely presented. The county appoints a voting majority of the authority&#39;s board. The chairman of the county board and the member appointed by the county board are clearly direct appointees of the county. Because the board of parks and recreation is appointed by the county board, its appointee is, in substance, also an appointee of the county. Further, because these three county appointees represent a voting majority of the five members that select the final two authority board members, those final two appointees also, in substance, result from county appointments. Only the two mayors are <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">not</b> directly or indirectly county appointees. Therefore, for purposes of determining financial accountability, the county appoints five of the seven members of the authority&#39;s board. The contract between the county and the authority clearly creates a financial burden relationship. The county&#39;s obligation to pay the entire hotel–motel tax to the authority is an obligation to &quot;provide financial support.&quot; The county only receives its stated share after the authority&#39;s debt service and operating expenses are paid, which creates an obligation for the county to finance the deficits of the authority. Whether or not the county has ever actually had to forgo its share of the hotel–motel tax to fund debt service or operating expenses for the authority is not relevant to the determination of whether a financial burden exists. The <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">obligation</b> to provide the funding creates a financial burden.</div></body></html>
