The town has no authority over the budget of the association; however, the town provides funding for approximately 90 percent of the library&#39;s funding for library operations. The library also receives donations and does a substantial amount of fund raising to finance capital improvements. The library board controls the management of the library&#39;s day-to-day operations and holds property in its own name.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> The library would be reported as a discretely presented component unit of the town. All of the library board members are either appointed directly by the town or selected by a group that is controlled by appointees, which means that the town does appoint a voting majority of the board. The funding provided by the town for the library&#39;s operations imposes a financial burden on the town.</div></body></html>
