The employer should account for the interfund activity between the governmental or proprietary fund type used to report retiree benefit-related activity and the funds that make retiree benefit-related payments to that fund in a manner consistent with the requirements of <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs34_par._112">paragraph 112</span> of Statement 34. (See also <span class="xref" href="gasb-cig" data-attr-href="gasb-cig#GASB-CIG_CompQA_Ch8_Q118c">Question 8.38.7</span> for additional guidance related to use of an internal service fund for this purpose.)</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Alternatively, OPEB expense or expenditures and liabilities could be reported in the funds that make retiree benefit-related payments to the insurance fund. Those payments into the insurance fund and the payments of insurance premiums or claims from the insurance fund would be accounted for by crediting and charging a “pass-through” account (liability account) in the insurance fund. Using this approach, the reported revenues and expenses of the insurance fund would reflect only resource flows related to active-employee healthcare benefits.</div></body></html>
