Pooling agreements usually specify whether any assessments other than premiums will be required of a participant to cover claims and related expenses if the pool experiences losses in excess of premiums. However, even if a pool has no recourse against a participant to make additional assessments for a higher than expected loss experience, the participant should still evaluate the pool&#39;s ability to continue as a going concern. If the pool&#39;s financial capacity or stability is in doubt, a participant may need to accrue or disclose loss contingencies for its own claims that the pool may not be able to cover.</div></body></html>
