A portfolio consisting of various debt investments with differing credit quality ratings may be aggregated and displayed by credit quality. For example, a government holds debt investments that have the two highest credit quality ratings issued by three NRSROs: AAA and AA by NRSRO1, Aaa and Aa by NRSRO2, and AAA and AA by NRSRO3. The government may choose to disclose that its investment portfolio contains AAA/Aaa/AAA rated government securities and AA/Aa/AA rated corporate bonds. A government holding investments with split ratings should, at a minimum, aggregate the investment with the rating indicative of the greatest degree of risk.
