The lending is managed by the system's custodial bank. All loans can be terminated on demand by either the system or the borrowers, although the average term of loans is one week. The custodial bank and its affiliates are prohibited from borrowing the system's securities.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">The agent lends the system's U.S. government and agency securities and domestic corporate fixed-income and equity securities for securities or cash collateral of 102 percent. The securities lending contracts do not allow the system to pledge or sell any collateral securities unless the borrower defaults. All securities loans can be terminated on demand by either the system or the borrower, although the average term of the loans is one week. Cash collateral is invested in the agent's collateral investment pool, which has share values based on the amortized cost of the pool's investments. At year-end, the pool has a weighted average term to maturity of 28 days. There are no restrictions on the amount of securities that can be lent at one time or to one borrower.</div><div class="p ps_para_2" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_2">Before the lending transactions and the investment of the cash collateral, the system's investments are as shown in the following table. Except for mutual funds, the system's agent holds investment securities in the system's name. The system's agent is not affiliated or related to investment brokers. Accordingly, the system is not exposed to custodial credit risk. Investments in mutual funds are not subject to custodial credit risk.
