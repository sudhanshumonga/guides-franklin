What information should be presented if a government chooses to provide prior-year data?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Comparative data are not <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">required,</b> but <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">may</b> be provided—so there is no specific presentation that <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">should</b> be made. The practicality of presenting prior-year information is often a function of the complexity of the reporting government. A government with only governmental or business-type activities and no component units could provide a side-by-side single-column comparison in the statement of net position. At the other extreme, a government with both governmental and business-type activities and component units (and the required total column for the primary government) would have to add at least four columns to offer a full comparison, or add a total column for the reporting entity (optional) and its counterpart from the prior year to provide for a reporting entity comparison.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Presenting comparative data for the statement of activities again depends on the complexity of the operations of the reporting government. A government with only governmental activities and no component units could add a prior-year &quot;net (expense) revenue and changes in net position&quot; column. However, the comparison becomes more difficult and space-consuming as more columns are presented (governmental activities, business-type activities, total primary government, and component units) for the current year.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">Governments with complex structures and operations may find that the most useful comparisons (especially for the statement of activities) can be made only if the prior-year statements are reproduced and included with the current-year statements of net position and activities. In all cases, the prior-year information should be clearly identified and distinguished from the current-year statements.
