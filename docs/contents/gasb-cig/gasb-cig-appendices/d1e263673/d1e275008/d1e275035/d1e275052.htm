Employees are eligible to receive benefits only for covered illnesses and events that occur during active employment. Required annual contributions to the fund are actuarially determined. Participants (the governments) pay a pro rata share of the required annual contributions based on total payroll costs for the prior year. Claims are paid from the fund up to an aggregate limit. Excess insurance is purchased for the remainder of claims. The state is not a participant in the fund. It uses a separate fund to account for the healthcare costs of its active employees. </div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Determination:</b> This activity meets the definition of a public entity risk pool (where there is transfer or pooling of risk) for purposes of applying Statement 10: The participants are local governments, there is a cooperative effort, and there is transfer of risk.</div></body></html>
