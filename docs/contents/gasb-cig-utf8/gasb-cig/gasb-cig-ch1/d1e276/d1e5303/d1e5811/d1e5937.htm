The CMO structure enables the issuer to direct the principal and interest cash flow generated by the collateral to the different tranches in a prescribed manner to meet these different investment objectives. Depending on the type of tranche held, the CMO security may or may not be considered an investment with a fair value that is highly sensitive to interest rate changes. Tranches usually not highly sensitive to changes in interest rates may be considered highly sensitive on account of higher-than-expected prepayments that may make what appears to be a more stable tranche become volatile. The longer the term to maturity of a particular CMO tranche, the more susceptible the tranche is to fluctuations in fair value. (See Questions 1.64.6–1.64.8.)</div></body></html>
