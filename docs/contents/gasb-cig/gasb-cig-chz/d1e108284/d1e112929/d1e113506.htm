The government receives the grant proceeds and deposits them in a separate special revenue fund. The government’s matching amount is transferred in from the general fund. How should the amount transferred in be classified? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The government’s 20 percent match, regardless of whether it is transferred to the special revenue fund or retained in the general fund, becomes bound by the same constraints imposed by the grantor agency on the award. Therefore, in this example, both the grant proceeds and the government’s matching amount would be classified as restricted fund balance. </div></body></html>
