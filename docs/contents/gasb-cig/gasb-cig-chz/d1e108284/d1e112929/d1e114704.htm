The general fund includes an asset for taxes receivable and a liability for accrued salaries. Therefore, those budgeted receipts and disbursements for next year are already factored into the calculation of fund balance at the end of the current year. The budget for the next year reflects an excess of appropriations over revenues, and the government has appropriated a portion of fund balance to eliminate the excess. This appropriated portion to balance the budget is classified as assigned fund balance in the current year. Is the government required to further adjust the amount of fund balance assigned for the budgeted receipts and disbursements that are already reflected in fund balance?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. An adjustment for basis of accounting differences is not required. The provision in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs54_par.16">paragraph 16</span> of Statement 54 states that the assignment should be “in an amount no greater than the projected excess of expected expenditures over expected revenues.”</div></body></html>
