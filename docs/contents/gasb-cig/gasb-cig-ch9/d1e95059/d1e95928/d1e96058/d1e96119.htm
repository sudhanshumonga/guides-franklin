A government also might consider beginning to present revenue capacity information for an own-source revenue as it is nearing the size of the own-source revenue already being reported, rather than waiting until it has surpassed the present own-source revenue.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The alternative—ceasing to report the first own-source revenue in favor of reporting the newly most significant own-source revenue—potentially could be detrimental to financial report users in at least two ways. Users would no longer be able to analyze the revenue source for which they previously had information. Furthermore, if the government begins to report revenue capacity information for the new most significant own-source revenue prospectively but does not immediately present information for the full 10 years, users will not have any revenue capacity trend information. Nevertheless, a government is not required to present information about more than one own-source revenue.</div></body></html>
