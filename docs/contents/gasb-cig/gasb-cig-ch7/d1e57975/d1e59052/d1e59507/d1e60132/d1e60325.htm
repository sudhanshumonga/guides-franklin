A subsystem is composed of all assets that make up a portion or segment of a network. For example, a water distribution system of a government could be considered a network. Pumping stations, storage facilities, and distribution mains could be considered subsystems of that network. Airport pavements could also be considered a network, with runways, taxiways, and aprons considered as subsystems. Another example of a network is a storm sewer system, with catch basins, storm drains, and inlets considered as subsystems.</div></body></html>
