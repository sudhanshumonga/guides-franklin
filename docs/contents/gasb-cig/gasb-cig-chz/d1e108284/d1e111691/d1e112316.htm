What types of tasks would be considered data conversion activities, and in what instance may data conversion activities be considered necessary to make internally generated computer software operational? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A—</b>Tasks that would be considered data conversion activities may include the purging or cleansing of existing data, conversion of data from the legacy system to the new system, and reconciliation of the data from the legacy system and the data in the new system. An example of an instance in which data conversion activities may be considered necessary to make internally generated computer software operational is a human resources system for which the effective processing of payroll transactions is dependent on the transfer of information, such as pay rates, payroll withholding data, and employee direct deposit information, from the legacy system. Conversely, a database system containing vendor information and performance feedback may be less reliant on converted legacy data to be considered operational because the data provided by such a system may be more informational in nature and not essential to undertaking current procurement transactions. Therefore, this database system may be considered operational prior to the completion of any data conversion. In this case, the data conversion activities should be considered part of the post-implementation/operation stage of development, and the associated outlays should be expensed as incurred.</div></body></html>
