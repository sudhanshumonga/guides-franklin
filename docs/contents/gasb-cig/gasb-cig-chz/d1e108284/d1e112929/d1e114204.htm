Tax collections from all levies are received in the general fund. Collections from the dedicated levies are recognized as &quot;due to other funds,&quot; rather than revenue in the general fund, and distributed to other funds for expenditure in accordance with the specific purposes for which they were levied. Do those distributions constitute restricted revenues in the receiving funds so that they can be reported as special revenue funds? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes, the taxes represent restricted revenues and a receiving fund could be reported as a special revenue fund, provided that the taxes and other restricted or committed revenues represent a substantial portion of the inflows into the fund. </div></body></html>
