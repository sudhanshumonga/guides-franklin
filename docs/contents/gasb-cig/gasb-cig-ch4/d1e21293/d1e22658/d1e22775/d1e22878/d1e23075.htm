Paragraph 21 notes that &quot;accountability flows from the notion that individuals are obliged to account for their acts, including the acts of the officials they appoint to operate governmental agencies. . . .&quot; This accountability would include appointments made by the officials of component units, related organizations, and other primary government appointees. For example, the governing board of a legally separate authority consists of:</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">•The mayor of City A (the county seat).</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">•The mayor of City B (another municipality in the county).</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">•A member appointed by the county board.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_1">•A member appointed by the parks and recreation board. (The parks and recreation board is a seven-member body appointed by the county board.)</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">•The chairman of the county board.</div><div class="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2 p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_para_bullet_list_2">•Two members appointed by a majority vote of the other five.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The chairman of the county board and the member appointed by the county board are clearly direct appointees of the county. (Note that footnote 5 of Statement 14 states that &quot;appointment&quot; includes officials serving as required by law.) Because the parks and recreation board is appointed by the county board, its appointee is, in substance, also an appointee of the county. Further, because these three county appointees represent a voting majority of the five members who select the final two authority board members, those final two appointees also, in substance, result from county appointments. Only the two mayors are<b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic"> not</b> directly or indirectly county appointees. Thus, for purposes of determining financial accountability, the county appoints five of the seven members of the authority&#39;s board.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">The conclusion is different, however, if the parks and recreation commission is included as a component unit of the county because it is both fiscally dependent on the county and there is a potential for it to provide specific financial benefits to, or impose specific financial burden on, the county and its board is <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">not</b> appointed by the county. Under those conditions, there is no unbroken line of appointment between the county board and the appointees of the parks and recreation board. Thus, only the county board chairman and the member directly appointed by the county board would qualify as county appointees.</div></body></html>
