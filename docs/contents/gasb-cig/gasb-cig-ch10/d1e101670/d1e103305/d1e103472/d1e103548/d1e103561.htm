The expected bond issuance qualifies as an expected transaction based on the criteria in <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.29">paragraph 29</span> of Statement 53. In order to hedge against interest rate risk prior to issuance of the bond, the school district enters into an interest rate lock. The interest rate lock is determined to be a hedging derivative instrument. How does the uncertain timing of the expected bond issuance impact subsequent evaluation of the hedging relationship and the treatment of the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—The school district should base its treatment of the hedging relationship and the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources upon its best estimate of the probable terms of the expected transaction (the bond issuance) and the hedging derivative instrument (the interest rate lock) as of the date of the financial statements.</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">If the school district’s best estimate of the timing of the bond issuance indicates that it is probable that the issuance will not occur prior to the termination of the interest rate lock, then there has been a termination event (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.22">paragraph 22b</span>). In the period in which this best estimate changes to indicate a termination event, the balance of the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources would be removed and recognized in the resource flows statement within the investment revenue classification (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.23">paragraph 23</span>, as amended).</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph">On the other hand, if the school district’s best estimate indicates that it is probable that the bond issuance will occur prior to the termination of the interest rate lock, then the termination event would be the occurrence of the expected transaction. Until this termination event occurs (or another termination event such as the one described in the above paragraph), the changes in fair value of the interest rate lock should continue to be reported in the balance of the deferred outflow of resources or deferred inflow of resources. </div></body></html>
