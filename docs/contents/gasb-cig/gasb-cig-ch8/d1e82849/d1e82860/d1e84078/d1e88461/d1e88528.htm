The premiums, for which payments are made before a disability-retired member&#39;s separation from employment, ensure payment of benefits for covered events that occur during the premium period. Is such an arrangement considered an insured benefit?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes. Because premium payments are made during the period of the member&#39;s active service and transfer to the insurer the risk of providing benefits after employment for disabling events that occur during the period covered by the payment of premiums, such an arrangement should be treated as an insured plan. Benefits provided under the arrangement should be accounted for and reported in accordance with <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs45_par._28">paragraph 28</span> of Statement 45.</div></body></html>
