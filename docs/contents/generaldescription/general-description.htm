Today’s modern Personal Spaceship is ready to go with a hydrogen and oxygen mix in an external tank and solid rockets for auxiliary takeoff power.</p><p class="p" data-attr-status="new">Flight used to depend on the direction of the wind to travel in a hot air balloon. Then, with the invention of the engine, and the adaption to an aircraft we could control the direction and speed of flight within the earth’s atmosphere. Today, using a mix of hydrogen and oxygen in an external tank and solid rockets for initial takeoff we can control travel in space. Using solar sails and other emerging technologies we can even travel to other planets, and soon, reach other stars!</p><dl class="dl"><div class="dlentry"><dt class="dt">Propeller based flight</dt><dd class="dd">A type of fan that converts rotating motions into thrust.
