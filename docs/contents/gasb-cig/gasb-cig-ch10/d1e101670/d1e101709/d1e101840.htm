Under this contract, the government agrees to pay a specified price for a specified quantity of the commodity, whether or not it takes delivery. The government uses the commodity in its operations, and the quantity specified in the contract is consistent with the government’s activities. It is probable that the government will take delivery of the commodity specified in the contract. Does this form of take-or-pay contract meet the definition of a derivative instrument in Statement 53, and, if so, should it be reported according to its requirements?</div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—Yes, this form of take-or-pay contract meets the definition of a derivative instrument (<span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasb-op_gasbs53_par.7">paragraph 7</span> of Statement 53).
