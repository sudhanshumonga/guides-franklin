The Memorial Stadium Authority (MSA), a public benefit corporation, was created for that purpose. On dissolution of the corporation, the net position of the MSA will be shared equally by the city and the county. The MSA is governed by a six-member board composed of three appointees from the city and three from the county. The city and the county are each obligated by contract to remit $250,000 annually to supplement the MSA's operating revenues. The change in the MSA's net position for the year is allocated equally to the city and the county, in accordance with the joint venture agreement. The MSA remitted $350,000 to the city for 20X2. The distribution, net of the $250,000 payment to the Authority, is included in miscellaneous revenues of the general fund. The city's equity interest in the MSA was $2.3 million at December 31, 20X2, and is reported as a governmental activities asset in the statement of net position. Complete financial statements for the MSA can be obtained from the MSA's administrative office at 460 Stadium Drive, Sample City, from the county clerk's office at the courthouse, or from the Sample City Finance Department at City Hall.</div><div class="p ps_secondary_heading" data-attr-outputclass="ps_secondary_heading">E.
