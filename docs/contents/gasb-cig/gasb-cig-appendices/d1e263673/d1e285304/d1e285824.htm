The authority is governed by a five-member board of commissioners, one of whom is a member of the city council serving ex officio. The other four commissioners of the authority&#39;s original board were appointed by the mayor; subsequent vacancies in the appointed seats are filled by appointments of the remaining hospital board members. These appointments require the confirmation of city council; however, the city council may not reject an appointee. The authority approves its own budget, holds title to the hospital assets, and controls the day-to-day operations of the hospital. The authority may apply for and accept federal grants and may issue its own revenue bonds. The city usually provides funding for indigent care and may appropriate and transfer additional funds to the authority.</div><div class="ps_para_1_sm-tab p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_para_1_sm-tab"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">Conclusion:</b> Because the city council&#39;s approval of the appointments of the board is not substantive and the city council does not have the authority to abolish the organization, the authority would be evaluated as a potential component unit based on the fiscal dependency criteria, which include the financial benefit or burden criteria, and the criteria in Statement 39. The authority is legally separate, approves its own budget, sets its own rates, and issues its own debt, which indicates that it is fiscally independent of the city. Similarly, the criteria from Statement 39 are not met. Therefore, inclusion would not be required. However, if the city council had the authority to reject appointments of new members, the approval authority would be substantive and the determination would be based on whether there was an imposition of will or financial benefit/burden relationship. In that event, the pattern and nature of funding by the city would need to be analyzed. Funding for indigent care could be considered as an exchange transaction, but the appropriation of additional funds would probably constitute a financial burden on the city.</div></body></html>
