For example, if a component unit of a city was <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">blended</b> because its governing board is substantively the same as the primary government’s board and there is operational responsibility, the disclosure requirements would be satisfied by stating that “even though it is legally separate, it is reported as if it were part of the city because the city council also serves as the governing board of the component unit and management of the primary government has operational responsibility for the component unit.” If a component unit was <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">discretely presented,</b> it is sufficient to state that it is “reported in a separate column(s) to emphasize that it is legally separate from the primary government and is governed by a separate board.” If there are no discretely presented component units, the notes should not include a discussion of discrete presentation as a method of displaying component unit data. Paragraph 61, as amended, provides that “component units may be disclosed together if they have common characteristics as long as each component unit is separately identified.” </div></body></html>
