Does this feature cause the investment's maturity to be very short term and presented as having a maturity of less than one year, such as under the segmented time distribution method?</div><div class="p ps_cqa_sub-paragraph" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. Consideration should be given to the distinction between a mutual bond fund's or external investment pool's <b class="b ph italic display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">maturity </b>and the flow of deposits and withdrawals. Governments may add monies to mutual bond funds or external investment pools or withdraw monies based on cash flow needs rather than when the investments mature. As stated in Question 1.57.5, a bond fund (and by extension an external investment pool) may report average maturity weighted by the par value of each bond. It is the focus on the bond fund's or external investment pool's maturity that should be considered when designating the investment into the appropriate time distribution for interest rate risk disclosure.</div></body></html>
