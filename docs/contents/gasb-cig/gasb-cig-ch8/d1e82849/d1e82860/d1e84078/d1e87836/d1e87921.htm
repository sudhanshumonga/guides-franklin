The participating employer governments make contributions, described as contractually required contributions, to one of the governments, which acts as the plan administrator. The plan&#39;s policy for determining the contribution amounts assessed to the participating employers each year results in contributions in excess of the plan&#39;s pay-as-you-go requirements for health insurance premiums and administrative costs. The fund used by the administrator government is not a qualifying trust, or equivalent arrangement. Thus, the assets accumulated in the fund are not legally or effectively secured for the sole purpose of paying benefits to plan members as they come due in the future. Should an employer participating in this plan account for the amounts it contributes to the plan as contractually required contributions? </div><div class="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph p" data-attr-outputclass="ps_cqa_sub-paragraph"> <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">A</b>—No. If a multiple-employer plan is not administered as a qualifying trust, or equivalent arrangement, <span class="xref" href="gasb-op" data-attr-href="gasb-op#gasbs45_par._22b">paragraph 22b</span> of Statement 45 requires participating employers to follow the requirements of Statement 45, as amended, applicable to an <b class="italic ph b display-inline" data-attr-outputclass="italic">agent employer. </b>Accordingly, an employer in such a plan should measure its OPEB expense related to contributions to the plan in an amount equal to annual OPEB cost. Moreover, the employer should not account for any contributions made to the plan in excess of pay-as-you-go requirements for benefits and plan expenses as contributions in relation to the ARC, but it should account for its share of the assets held by the administrator arising from such excess contributions as employer assets.</div></body></html>
